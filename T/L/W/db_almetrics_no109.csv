Psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular events, obesity and psychiatric disorders, which can all affect the course of sleep disorders. A systematic review of the literature on the relationship between psoriasis, PsA, and formal sleep disorders identified 33 studies. There is an increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with 36%-81.8% prevalence in psoriasis versus 2%-4% in the general population. There was also an increase in the prevalence of restless legs syndrome of 15.1%-18% in psoriasis versus 5%-10% in European and North American samples. The wide variety of insomnia criteria used in studies resulted in an insomnia prevalence of 5.9%-44.8% in psoriasis, which is insufficient to show an elevated prevalence when the general population has a 10% prevalence of chronic insomnia and 30-35% prevalence of transient insomnia. There is evidence that symptoms of insomnia in psoriasis are directly mediated by pruritus and pain. Treatments that decrease the cutaneous symptoms in psoriasis were successful in mitigating insomnia, but did not show improvements in OSA where the relationship with psoriasis is multifactorial.;7945514;67131662353268;3698968;51;4068997;491;13350783673469;338;29;144;239637;93922657447128;103040;53;128030;15;15601857142857;13;13;2;Gupta, Madhulika A;Simpson, Fiona C;Gupta, Aditya K;Madhulika A.

Fifteen articles about psoriasis and 13 about acne (12 having a control group) were included. No study in rosacea met our inclusion criteria. For psoriasis, one study out of three controlled studies showed increased skin colonization (OR 18.86; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2.20-161.99). Three out of the five studies that reported on nasal colonization showed significant ORs varying from 1.73 (95 % CI 1.16-2.58) to 14.64 (95 % CI 2.82-75.95). For acne one of the three studies that evaluated skin colonization reported a significant OR of 4.16 (95 % CI 1.74-9.94). A relation between nasal colonization and acne was not found. Limitations in study design and low sample sizes should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Colonisation with S. aureus seems to be increased in patients with psoriasis.

3;3;The Effect of TNF Inhibitors on Cardiovascular Events in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis: an Updated Meta-Analysis;10.1007/s12016-016-8560-9;27300248;#NoSurprise #TNFInhibitors lower #Cardiovascular Events in #Psoriasis patients #humira #enbrel #AskDrG;The Effect of TNF Inhibitors on Cardiovascular Events in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis: an Updated…;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa6123cf058f610006f22;1559-0267;1080-0549;NA;Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology;1;NA;"TNF inhibitors have been used in psoriasis (Pso) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which were associated with increased risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. However, whether TNF inhibitors reduce cardiovascular event is still unclear. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of TNF inhibitors on adverse cardiovascular events (CVEs) in Pso with or without PsA. We undertook a meta-analysis of clinical trials identified in systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Wanfang database, Cochrane Database, and Google scholar through December 31, 2015. Five studies (49,795 patients) were included. Overall, compared with topical/photo treatment, TNF inhibitors were associated with a significant lower risk of CVE (RR, 0.58; 95 % CI, 0.43 to 0.77; P < 0.001; I (2) = 66.2 %). Additionally, compared with methotrexate (MTX) treatment, risk of CVE was also markedly decreased in the TNF inhibitor group (RR, 0.67; 95 % CI, 0.52 to 0.88; P = 0.003; I (2) = 9.3 %). Meanwhile, TNF inhibitors were linked to reduced incidence of myocardial infarction compared with topical/photo or MTX treatment (RR, 0.73; 95 % CI, 0.59 to 0.90; P = 0.003; I (2) = 56.2 % and RR, 0.65; 95 % CI, 0.48 to 0.89; P = 0.007; I (2) = 0.0 %, respectively). Furthermore, there was a trend of decreased rate of mortality in the TNF inhibitor group compared with other therapy (RR, 0.90; 95 % CI, 0.54 to 1.50; P = 0.68; I (2) = 70.9 %). TNF inhibitors appear to have net clinical benefits with regard to adverse cardiovascular events in Pso and/or PsA. Rigorous randomized controlled trials will need to evaluate whether TNF inhibitors truly result in reduction of cardiovascular diseases.";8058126;68389387129106;470937;94;7585762;316;48195428571429;13;95;303;269175;11588694970539;24424;90;244669;19;31127777777778;1;94;18;Yang, Zheng-Sheng;Lin, Ning-Ning;Li, Li;Li, Yang;Zheng-sheng Yang;Ning-ning Lin;Li Li;Yang Li;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;8758088;1.5.4;FALSE;Allergology;Immunology;springer;springer;4;1;4;NA;1468165879;17.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;17.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12016-016-8560-9;1465991920;1465862400;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;12;0;12;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=18&types=mmmmttff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=18&types=mmmmttff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=18&types=mmmmttff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=8758088;Internal Medicine;Medicine & Public Health;Immunology;springer;springer;era

Clinics include enthesitis or dactylitis and extra-articular involvement as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, while treatment options range from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to biologics, targeting TNF alpha or Th17. No serum autoantibody is associated with PsA, while other biomarkers have been proposed for early diagnosis or to predict treatment response. To better discuss this area of growing interest we performed a systematic review of the literature on biomarkers in PsA. Our research retrieved 408 papers, and 38 were included in the analysis. Based on the available literature, we draw some recommendations for the use of biomarkers in the management of patients with PsA.;8059538;68397725663364;4029128;47;3826041;537;24609291044776;188;59;319;287682;10928705169962;144877;45;132002;36;20657142857143;12;63;23;Elena Generali;Carlo A.

This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of education which specifically addresses HRQoL among people with chronic inflammatory skin conditions. We searched 12 literature databases and other sources (to July 2014). Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the review inclusion criteria, from which data were extracted and critically appraised. Two RCTs showed that for psoriasis in adults, group-based and text message education (as adjuncts to usual care), respectively, resulted in better HRQoL and disease severity outcomes than comparators. One RCT found group-based education for children with eczema (atopic dermatitis) and their parents resulted in greater improvements in parents' HRQoL and the children's disease severity than no education at 12 months. The remaining RCTs evaluated an educational session for psoriasis, a website for carers of children with eczema, information on skin care and make-up use given to women with acne, and an itch coping programme for a range of conditions, all as adjuncts to usual care. None found statistically significant effects on HRQoL or disease severity compared to usual care. Common features of the effective interventions were long delivery (over 6 weeks to three months) and delivery by a multi-disciplinary team. Overall, the evidence base is currently limited and generally of an unclear risk of bias. There is a need for more large RCTs evaluating piloted and theory-based interventions.

The aim of this study was to investigate published literature dealing with medical adherence to topical corticosteroid or corticosteroid combinations in patients with psoriasis. Systematic electronic searches in English language literature were done until September 2015 without publication date restriction. We identified 11 studies consisting of five surveys, two prospective studies, one qualitative study, one mixed-method study, one register study, and one interventional study. Observation periods varied and rates of nonadherence ranged from 8% to 88.3%. The rates were reported by patients on eight nonvalidated scales and one validated scale, measured by medication weight in two studies, and in two studies rates of nonadherence were measured using prescription registers. Thirty-four multifactorial determinants of nonadherence were found. One designed intervention consisted of a disease management program, which improved adherence in the study period. Overall, the studies included were heterogeneous in design and had a high risk of bias. To improve health outcome in topical treatment of psoriasis, further studies should be conducted addressing determinants of nonadherence and test interventions to improve adherence. Validated measurements of medical nonadherence, prescription registers, or medication-weight are needed.;7987814;67359164730015;4193518;27;2231756;397;3462101010101;191;30;122;269216;11450093382612;145729;36;97752;8;20857142857143;6;25;2;Svendsen, Mathias Tiedemann;Andersen, Flemming;Hansen, Jakob;Johannessen, Helle;Andersen, Klaus Ejner;Mathias Tiedemann Svendsen;Flemming Andersen;Jakob Hansen;Helle Johannessen;Klaus Ejner Andersen;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;7277023;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;2;1;1;NA;1491387155;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2016.1178375;1462798175;1462492800;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;5;0;5;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=7277023;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
10;8;Safety and Efficacy of Methotrexate in Psoriasis: A Meta-Analysis of Published Trials;10.1371/journal.pone.0153740;27168193;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3;NA;NA;NA;PLoS ONE;1;NA;Methotrexate (MTX) has been used to treat psoriasis for over half a century. Even so, clinical data characterising its efficacy and safety are sparse. In order to enhance the available evidence, we conducted two meta-analyses, one for efficacy and one for safety outcomes, respectively, according to PRISMA checklist. (Data sources, study criteria, and study synthesis methods are detailed in Methods). In terms of efficacy, only eleven studies met criteria for study design and passed a Cochrane risk of bias analysis. Based on this limited dataset, 45.2% [95% confidence interval 34.1-60.0] of patients achieve PASI75 at primary endpoint (12 or 16 weeks, respectively, n = 705 patients across all studies), compared to a calculated PASI75 of 4.4 [3.5-5.6] for placebo, yielding a relative risk of 10.2 [95% C.I. 7.1-14.7]. For safety outcomes, we extended the meta-analysis to include studies employing the same dose range of MTX for other chronic inflammatory conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, in order not to maximise capture of relevant safety data. Based on 2763 patient safety years, adverse events (AEs) were found treatment limiting in 6.9 ± 1.4% (mean ± s.e.) of patients treated for six months, with an adverse effect profile largely in line with that encountered in clinical practice. Finally, in order to facilitate prospective clinical audit and to help generate long-term treatment outcomes under real world conditions, we also developed an easy to use documentation form to be completed by patients without requirement for additional staff time.

15;10;Methodologies for medication adherence evaluation: Focus on psoriasis topical treatment;10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.02.008;26917347;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4f;0923-1811;1873-569X;NA;Journal of Dermatological Science;1;NA;Adherence to topical treatment has been less studied in comparison with systemic therapeutic regimens and is poorly understood. High-quality research on this area is essential to outline a strategy to increase medication adherence and clinical outcomes. For a more comprehensive understanding of this issue, a systematic review of the methodologies for topical treatment adherence evaluation in psoriasis was undertaken. Twenty one studies were selected from the literature which used six different adherence methodologies. Merely three studies used multiple adherence measurement methods. The most used method was questionnaire (44%) which was also associated with higher variability of the adherence results. One possible explanation is the lack of a validated questionnaire designed specifically for the evaluation of adherence to topical treatment. Only one method (medication weight) takes into consideration the applied dose. However, the estimation of the expected weight is complex, which renders this method, as used presently, less effective. The use of a dosing device could improve its accuracy and be helpful to clearly instruct the patients about the correct dose. As there is no single method that allows an accurate and complete assessment of adherence it is recommended to use a combination of methods, including self-report and medicines' weight measurements.;7252957;63649994636635;3682283;28;2052578;399;31243819095477;166;42;170;283760;10397077893564;152819;35;101269;20;35026315789474;9;45;9;Ana Teixeira;Maribel Teixeira;Vera Almeida;Tiago Torres;José Manuel Sousa Lobo;Isabel Filipa Almeida;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;5973473;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;1;1;NA;1456226498;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.02.008;1456226656;1455753600;NA;NA;Health Sciences;Medicine;Life Sciences;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology;0;13;0;13;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=5973473;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

There are limited data on the safety of immunosuppressive therapy for these patients. Published studies have been small with few events, precluding robust estimates of risk. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and conference proceedings for terms related to immune mediated disease, immune-suppressive therapy, and cancer recurrence from inception to April 2015. We included 16 studies (9 of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 8 of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and of patients with psoriasis) and stratified studies by type of immune-suppressive therapy (monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF], conventional immune-modulatory agents, or no immune suppression). A random effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled incidence rates as well as risk differences between the various treatments. Our analysis included 11,702 persons contributing 31,258 person-years (p-y) of follow up after a prior diagnosis of cancer. Rates of cancer recurrence were similar among individuals receiving anti-TNF therapy (33.8/1000 p-y), immune-modulator therapy (36.2/1000 p-y), or no immunosuppression (37.5/1000 p-y), but were numerically higher among patients receiving combination immune suppression (54.5/1000 p-y) (P>.1 for all). Subgroup analysis of new and recurrent cancers separately, type of immune-modulator therapy, or immune-mediated disease revealed similar results, with no increase in risk. We found similar pooled incidence values for new or primary cancers when immunosuppression was initiated within 6 years (33.6/1000 p-y for immune-modulatory agents and 43.7/1000 p-y for anti-TNF agents) vs more 6 years after the index cancer (32.9/1000 p-y for immune-modulatory agents; P=.86 and 21.0/1000 p-y for anti-TNF agents; P=.43) CONCLUSION: In a meta-analysis of 16 studies, we observed similar rates of cancer recurrence among individuals with prior cancer who received no immunosuppression, anti-TNF therapy, immune-modulator therapy, or combination treatments. Prospective studies are needed to ascertain optimal intervals for re-initiation of immune suppressive therapies for individuals with specific cancers.";8010338;67659809933044;37542;99;7973076;5010;78190281493312;26;99;4984;277348;11194050269157;3013;98;274335;175;22524126436782;7;96;168;Edward Shelton;David Laharie;Frank I.

However, the efficacy of this combination needs to be consolidated. We aimed to assess the effects and safety profile of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, using evidence based approach. Randomized controlled trials on the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate were identified by searching PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcome measure was the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Ten randomized controlled trials involving 6590 participants were included. The methodologies of the studies were generally of moderate to high quality. These trials used topical calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate for 4 or 8 weeks, and were compared with topical calcipotriol or betamethasone. The results showed that calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate was more effective than controls. A four-week treatment with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate did not show any significant difference between the once-daily or twice-daily regimen. The adverse events of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate were tolerable and acceptable. The reports included in this review are heterogenous and have limitations. Topical application of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate once daily is an efficacious treatment for psoriasis vulgaris and is associated with few side effects.;7325869;63768565404091;3746925;28;2058653;417;26197211538462;164;43;180;282583;10655670382402;152742;35;100413;23;20877272727273;9;43;10;Yan, Ru;Jiang, Shibin;Wu, Yan;Gao, Xing-Hua;Chen, Hong-Duo;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;6029252;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;1;1;NA;1456831871;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0378-6323.175919;1456833004;1456869634;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;8;0;8;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=6029252;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
19;13;Is Oral Chinese Herbal Medicine Beneficial for Psoriasis Vulgaris? A Meta-Analysis of Comparisons with Acitretin;10.1089/acm.2014.0212;26919330;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c79;1557-7708;1075-5535;NA;Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine;NA;NA;Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic disease that significantly affects patient's quality of life and poses an economic burden. Acitretin is a second-generation retinoid used for psoriasis in clinical practice. Orally administered Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), alone or combined with acitretin, has been used for the clinical management of psoriasis vulgaris. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of oral CHM in comparison with acitretin and the add-on effect of oral CHM to acitretin. Five English databases and four Chinese databases were searched from their inceptions to May 2014. Included randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were published in English or Chinese, compared oral CHM or the combination of oral CHM and acitretin with acitretin, and used Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) as the outcome measure. A total of 25 RCTs were included in this review: 8 studies compared oral CHM with acitretin, 12 compared the combination with acitretin alone, and 5 were three-arm studies that compared both with acitretin. The meta-analysis indicated that oral CHM was effective for psoriasis vulgaris as follows: (1) Oral CHM is neither superior nor inferior to acitretin, and (2) oral CHM could produce add-on effects when combined with acitretin. Oral CHM itself appeared safe for treating psoriasis vulgaris and possibly could reduce the common adverse events seen with acitretin. However, the long-term effect and safety of oral CHM could not be assessed. Further research should consider including a placebo control and using outcome measures according to international guidelines to evaluate CHM, as well as include follow-ups to monitor longer-term efficacy and safety.;7571218;65337981331095;6556948;1;0;1472;12500299116247;1356;1;0;245437;12184508857706;209552;1;0;32;93767741935484;29;1;0;Zhang, Claire Shuiqing;Yang, Lihong;Zhang, Anthony Lin;May, Brian H;Yu, Jason Jingjie;Guo, Xinfeng;Lu, Chuanjian;Xue, Charlie Changli;ZhangClaire Shuiqing;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;10827304;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;NA;1;NA;1477014671;0.25;0.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/acm.2014.0212;1472147916;1456790400;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;6;0;6;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=ffffffff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=ffffffff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=ffffffff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=10827304;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate this risk by comprehensively reviewing all available data. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies that reported relative risk, hazard ratio, odds ratio, or standardized incidence ratio comparing the risk of PD in patients with psoriasis versus subjects without psoriasis. Pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effect, generic inverse variance methods of DerSimonian and Laird. Three retrospective studies and one case-control study met our eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio of PD in patients with psoriasis versus participants without psoriasis was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.15-1.66). The statistical heterogeneity was low with an I (2) of 35%.

Hair makes the scalp difficult to treat and the adjacent facial skin is particularly sensitive to topical treatments. To assess the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis. We searched the following databases up to August 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel-group, cross-over or within-patient design of topical treatments for people of all ages with scalp psoriasis. Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. Disagreements were settled by reference to a third author.To assess the quality of evidence, we focused on the following outcomes: 'clearance' or 'response' as assessed by the investigator global assessment (IGA), improvement in quality of life, adverse events requiring withdrawal of treatment and 'response' as assessed by the patient global assessment (PGA).We expressed the results of the single studies as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. If studies were sufficiently homogeneous, we meta-analysed the data by using the random-effects model. Where it was not possible to calculate a point estimate for a single study, we described the data qualitatively. We also presented the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB).We categorised topical corticosteroids according to the German classification of corticosteroid potency as mild, moderate, high and very high. We included 59 RCTs with a total of 11,561 participants. Thirty studies were either conducted or sponsored by the manufacturer of the study medication. The risk of bias varied considerably among the included studies. For instance, most authors did not state the randomisation method and few addressed allocation concealment. Most findings were limited to short-term treatments, since most studies were conducted for less than six months. Only one trial investigated long-term therapy (12 months). Although we found a wide variety of different interventions, we limited the grading of the quality of evidence to three major comparisons: steroid versus vitamin D, two-compound combination of steroid and vitamin D versus steroid monotherapy and versus vitamin D.In terms of clearance, as assessed by the IGA, steroids were better than vitamin D (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.18; four studies, 2180 participants, NNTB = 8; 95% CI 7 to 11; moderate quality evidence). Statistically, the two-compound combination was superior to steroid monotherapy, however the additional benefit was small (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36; four studies, 2474 participants, NNTB = 17; 95% CI 11 to 41; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination was more effective than vitamin D alone (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.87 to 2.78; four studies, 2008 participants, NNTB = 6; 95% CI 5 to 7; high quality evidence).In terms of treatment response, as assessed by the IGA, corticosteroids were more effective than vitamin D (RR 2.09; 95% CI 1.80 to 2.41; three studies, 1827 participants; NNTB = 4; 95% CI 4 to 5; high quality evidence). The two-compound combination was better than steroid monotherapy, but the additional benefit was small (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25; three studies, 2444 participants, NNTB = 13; 95% CI 9 to 24; moderate quality evidence). It was also more effective than vitamin D alone (RR 2.31; 95% CI 1.75 to 3.04; four studies, 2222 participants, NNTB = 3; 95% CI 3 to 4; moderate quality evidence).Reporting of quality of life data was poor and data were insufficient to be included for meta-analysis.Steroids caused fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.42; four studies, 2291 participants; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination and steroid monotherapy did not differ in the number of adverse events leading withdrawal (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.88; three studies, 2433 participants; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination led to fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.36; three studies, 1970 participants; high quality evidence). No study reported the type of adverse event requiring withdrawal.In terms of treatment response, as assessed by the PGA, steroids were more effective than vitamin D (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.72; three studies, 1827 participants; NNTB = 5; 95% CI 5 to 7; moderate quality evidence). Statistically, the two-compound combination was better than steroid monotherapy, however the benefit was not clinically important (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.20; two studies, 2226 participants; NNTB = 13; 95% CI 9 to 26; high quality evidence). The two-compound combination was more effective than vitamin D (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.12; four studies, 2222 participants; NNTB = 4; 95% CI 3 to 6; moderate quality evidence).Common adverse events with these three interventions were local irritation, skin pain and folliculitis. Systemic adverse events were rare and probably not drug-related.In addition to the results of the major three comparisons we found that the two-compound combination, steroids and vitamin D monotherapy were more effective than the vehicle. Steroids of moderate, high and very high potency tended to be similarly effective and well tolerated. There are inherent limitations in this review concerning the evaluation of salicylic acid, tar, dithranol or other topical treatments. The two-compound combination as well as corticosteroid monotherapy were more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy. Given the similar safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the steroid alone, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be fully acceptable for short-term therapy.Future RCTs should investigate how specific therapies improve the participants' quality of life. Long-term assessments are needed (i.e. 6 to 12 months).";7945514;67131662353268;177775;97;7767859;8735;17158622624227;651;92;8083;286980;10697345171598;11864;95;275114;190;25564105820106;28;85;162;Schlager, Justin Gabriel;Rosumeck, Stefanie;Werner, Ricardo Niklas;Jacobs, Anja;Schmitt, Jochen;Schlager, Christoph;Nast, Alexander;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;6012947;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;36;27;33;1;1481371626;47.03;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;47.03;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009687.pub2;1456571817;1456610507;healthservicesresearch;medicine;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;49;0;49;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=48&types=mbtttttf;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=48&types=mbtttttf;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=48&types=mbtttttf;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=6012947;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to September 2015. Selection criteria include (1) adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and PsA, (2) assessed in a multidisciplinary consultation, (3) comparison with routine separate consultations, and (4) outcome measures to evaluate efficacy and/or satisfaction. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, clinical trials, cohort studies, and case series were included. The quality of the studies included was graded according to the Oxford Level of Evidence scale. Of 195 articles, three studies complied with the inclusion criteria: two case series and one descriptive study in which 506 patients were evaluated. Patients were referred to the multidisciplinary consultation from dermatology and rheumatology consultations in all but one study, in which primary care was also involved. The reason for the referral was to confirm the diagnosis and/or treatment. Patients were evaluated on a weekly and monthly basis in two and one study, respectively. The evidence obtained is scarce but suggests the efficacy of multidisciplinary consultations in terms of improved skin and joint symptoms after changing treatment (82-56 %), showing higher scores for this type of consultation compared to the usual [4.91 vs. 2.85 (0-5)] and a high level of satisfaction among patients (94 % ""very satisfied""). However, waiting times were higher. With the limited evidence found, multidisciplinary management seems to be more effective and more satisfactory for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and PsA than conventional consultations, though this could not be conclusively demonstrated. The results of this review support the benefit of implementing this type of consultation.";6348733;59808086398984;1208711;80;5132189;678;31363456425406;105;84;571;194130;10243891185758;49884;74;143846;19;2.1;2;84;16;Cobo-Ibáñez, Tatiana;Villaverde, Virginia;Seoane-Mato, Daniel;Muñoz-Fernández, Santiago;Guerra, Mercedes;Del Campo, Petra Díaz;Cañete, Juan D;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4595314;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Medicine & Public Health;era;springer;6;6;6;NA;1445319195;4.2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;4.2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00296-015-3377-z;1444213310;1444255290;NA;NA;Health Sciences;Medicine;Life Sciences;Immunology and Microbiology;0;6;0;6;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=5&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=5&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=5&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4595314;Rheumatology;NA;NA;springer;NA;NA

To determine whether immunological serum markers IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-4, IL-17, IL-23, IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 are elevated or decreased in patients compared with healthy controls. Methods. A complete search of the literature on this topic within the past 30 years was conducted across seven databases. Seventeen studies including 768 individuals were identified. Differences in serum marker levels between subjects and controls were pooled as MDs using the random-effects model. Results. The pooled MDs were higher in patients than in healthy controls for IFN-<U+03B3> (MD 24.9, 95% CI 12.36-37.43), IL-17 (MD 28.92, 95% CI 17.44-40.40), IL-23 (MD 310.60, 95% CI 4.96-616.24), and TNF-a (MD 19.84, 95% CI 13.80-25.87). Pooled IL-4 (MD -13.5, 95% CI -17.74--9.26) and IL-10 (MD -10.33, 95% CI -12.03--8.63) levels were lower in patients. Conclusion. The pooled analyses suggest that levels of IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-a are significantly elevated and that levels of IL-4 and IL-10 are significantly decreased in sera of patients with psoriasis vulgaris of blood-heat syndrome.

Low levels of well-being and high levels of psychological distress are associated with psoriasis and reduced resources for self-care. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures can assess physical, social, and psychological functioning in order to guide treatment decision-making. Many psoriasis PRO measures exist; we systematically reviewed their development and validation to determine appropriateness for use in clinical management. PubMed (Medline), PsycInfo, and Cinhal from inception were systematically searched using pre-defined search terms and limited to English language and human subjects. Articles were selected for full review through explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria. PRO measures were critically reviewed in accordance with published guidelines and theory on the development and validation of PROs. The search identified 967 abstracts; 71 met criteria for full review. 45 PRO measures were found, 16 specific to psoriasis, 21 assessed other dermatological conditions, and 8 were developed for generic non-dermatological health conditions. The review revealed limitations of existing measures including: a) composite structure assessing multiple, poorly defined concepts; b) lack of evidence for face and content validity; d) failure to include both patient and clinician perspectives and requirements; and d) lack of evidence of the feasibility and acceptability for patients and physicians. No single PRO measure with adequate evidence of validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change captures patient wellbeing in psoriasis. A valid, sensitive, specific, and acceptable PRO to assess the full impact of psoriasis on wellbeing is needed for the comprehensive clinical management of psoriasis.

At present the epidemiology and natural history of psoriasis are not widely understood. This scoping review aimed to map the existing literature on the epidemiology of child-onset psoriasis, provide a comprehensive, clinically useful review and identify research gaps for future studies. Search strategies were developed for OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, Google Scholar and hand-searching; 131 articles meeting the inclusion criteria and were mapped and 107 articles were included for data extraction. Over 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the volume of published observational epidemiological studies on child-onset psoriasis. The majority were case series or cross-sectional studies, concentrated in Europe, Asia and North America. The prevalence of childhood psoriasis was found to be higher in European countries, older children and females. Up to 48.8% of children had a family history of psoriasis in a first degree relative. The most frequent subtype was plaque psoriasis and the most common initial sites of presentation were scalp, limbs and trunk. Specific genetic differences have been found between child-onset and adult-onset populations. Case-control studies and cohort studies investigating risk factors for psoriasis onset, comorbidities and long-term health outcomes were extremely limited. The choice of study design and heterogeneity in methodology limit the validity and generalisability of the information, consistency of the results and comparability of the studies. Well-designed studies are needed to provide precise and consistent information about the frequency and clinical presentation, risk factors, associated diseases and long-term outcomes in child-onset psoriasis.

Included studies were clinical trials and observational studies in adult outpatients treated for psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Intervention approaches were classified into four categories: educational, behavioral, cognitive behavioral, and multicomponent interventions. The risk of bias/study limitations of each study was assessed using the GRADE system. Fifteen studies (14 clinical trials and one observational study) met eligibility criteria and enrolled a total of 1958 patients. Forty percent of the studies (6/15) was conducted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, half (7/15) in rheumatoid arthritis patients, one in psoriasis patients and one in multiple sclerosis patients. Seven out of 15 interventions were classified as multicomponent, four as educational, two as behavioral and two as cognitive behavioral. Nine studies, of which five were multicomponent interventions, had no serious limitations according to GRADE criteria. Nine out of 15 interventions showed an improvement of adherence: three multicomponent interventions in inflammatory bowel disease; one intervention of each category in rheumatoid arthritis; one multicomponent in psoriasis and one multicomponent in multiple sclerosis.

44;25;Efficacy of combining oral Chinese herbal medicine and NB-UVB in treating psoriasis vulgaris: a systematic review and meta-analysis;10.1186/s13020-015-0060-y;26413149;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa6f73cf058f61000a1f1;NA;NA;NA;Chinese Medicine;3;NA;The combination of a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) bath and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) improved the efficacy of NB-UVB treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, but bath therapy is inconvenient. Oral CHM plus NB-UVB has been tested in clinical practice. This study aims to evaluate whether adding oral CHM could be beneficial for NB-UVB therapy by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Nine English and Chinese databases were searched from their inception to April 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the combination of orally administered CHM and NB-UVB with that of CHM placebo and NB-UVB or NB-UVB alone for treating psoriasis vulgaris and reporting Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) outcomes were included. A systematic review, meta-analysis, risk of bias assessment and the GRADE assessment were conducted in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration methodology to assess the evidence for efficacy outcome. Data were analyzed in RevMan5.2. Eighteen eligible RCTs (n = 1416) were included for systematic review, and 17 (n = 1342) of them were included in meta-analysis. Risk of bias in terms of blinding was high and so was in publication bias. Quality of evidence was low according the GRADE assessment. PASI-60 or above [risk ratio (RR) = 1.35, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.45, I(2) = 5 %, number needed to treat = 4.27] and PASI-90 or above (RR = 1.71, 95 % CI 1.45-2.01, I(2) = 0 %, number needed to treat = 5.92) were higher in the intervention group. The combination treatment conferred a 24 % benefit of PASI-60 or above (83 vs 59 %, RR = 1.35, 95 % CI 1.26-1.45, P < 0.01). The incidence of NB-UVB-induced adverse events was lower in the intervention group (95/464 vs 123/428, RR = 0.66, 95 % CI 0.46-0.96, P < 0.01). Mild gastrointestinal reactions (2.87 %) and liver function impairments (0.68 %) were reported in the intervention group. No serious adverse events were reported.

The increased production of adipocytokines in central adiposity contributes to the systemic inflammation of obesity and perhaps to psoriasis. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the association of obesity with psoriasis severity. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database for English-language papers involving human subjects for all years. We extracted data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), proportion obese, and psoriasis severity index score (PASI). We identified 254 articles in our search and included 9. The sample size was 134 823 psoriasis patients. Seven of the 9 studies found a statistically significant association of increased psoriasis severity with higher BMI. Increased severity of psoriasis appears to be associated with increased BMI. Most studies were cross-sectional or case-control, making it difficult to determine temporality. Dermatologists should consider recording BMI for psoriasis patients and offering them lifestyle counseling.;7945514;67131662353268;773708;89;7140027;179;24934719101124;9;93;168;227916;86257082245574;31301;85;195848;10;15722222222222;1;90;9;Fleming, Patrick;Kraft, John;Gulliver, Wayne P;Lynde, Charles;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4399658;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;3;1;2;NA;1461849780;10;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;10;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1203475415586332;1439633238;1441065600;generalsurgery;dermatology;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;14;0;14;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=10&types=mmmmtttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=10&types=mmmmtttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=10&types=mmmmtttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4399658;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Greater psoriasis severity and lower response to treatment have been linked to obesity. However, the effect of weight reduction by non-pharmacologic intervention on disease severity is still questionable. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the effect of dietary and lifestyle weight loss interventions on psoriasis severity. We comprehensively searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from their inception to August 2014. Inclusion criteria were RCT that examined lifestyle intervention by diet or exercise in overweight or obese patients with psoriasis and measured the severity of psoriasis as an outcome compared with controls. Two authors independently assessed article quality and extracted the data. Of 12 full-text articles, 7 RCT involving 878 participants met our inclusion criteria. Five of these RCT were included in the meta-analysis, which was based on the random-effects model. There was a greater reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score in patients receiving weight loss intervention than in controls, with a pooled mean difference of -2.49 (95% CI, -3.90 to -1.08; P=0.004). More participants in the intervention group than in the control group achieved a 75% reduction in the PASI score, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.92 (95% CI, 1.39-6.13; P=0.005). Nonpharmacologic, nonsurgical weight loss intervention is associated with reduction in the severity of psoriasis in overweight or obese patients. However, more RCT with more participants are needed to provide better quality of evidence.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 29 April 2015. doi:10.1038/ijo.2015.64.";7907411;66922707093667;269797;96;7637423;2332;15579626769627;239;89;2093;217993;84438574443099;10871;95;207114;80;21390759493671;14;82;66;S Upala;A Sanguankeo;Upala, S;Sanguankeo, A;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4058307;1.5.4;FALSE;Obesity;Medical And Health Sciences;npg;era;26;24;25;NA;1466079432;29.85;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;29.85;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2015.64;1432636082;1430265600;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;Nursing;NA;0;12;0;12;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=30&types=mttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=30&types=mttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=30&types=mttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4058307;Education;NA;NA;era;NA;NA

We conducted this systematic review to synthesize the highest quality evidence for the benefits and risks of FAE for psoriasis. Our primary outcomes were change in PASI score and drop-out rates due to adverse effects. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FAE or dimethyl fumarate were included, with no restriction on age or psoriasis subtype. We searched The Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, five trials registers and handsearched six conference proceedings. Six RCTs with 544 participants were included, four of which were published only as abstracts or brief reports, limiting study reporting. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo and all demonstrated benefit in favour of FAE but meta-analysis was only possible for PASI 50 after 12-16 weeks, which was achieved by 64% of participants on FAE compared to 14% on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.55; 95% CI 2.80 to 7.40; 2 studies; 247 participants; low quality evidence). There was no difference in drop-out rates due to adverse effects (RR 5.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 102.12; 1 study; 27 participants; very low-quality evidence and wide confidence interval). More participants experienced nuisance adverse effects with FAE (76%) compared to placebo (16%) (RR 4.72, 95% CI 2.45 to 9.08; 1 study; 99 participants; moderate-quality evidence), mainly abdominal pain, diarrhoea and flushing. One head-to-head study of very low quality evidence comparing FAE with methotrexate reported comparable efficacy and drop-out rates, although FAE caused more flushing. The evidence in this review was limited and must be interpreted with caution; better designed and reported studies are needed. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study we evaluated the significance of serum resistin levels in psoriasis patients using a meta-analysis approach. Relevant articles were retrieved by searching the following English and Chinese databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Springer Link, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The retrieved studies were subjected to a thorough screening procedure to identify case-control studies that contained the required data. Data was extracted from each study and Version 12.0 STATA statistical software was employed for statistical analyses. Nine case-control studies, containing 421 psoriasis patients and 348 healthy controls, were included in this study. The major result of the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant association between serum resistin levels and psoriasis (SMD<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.22, 95%CI: 1.14-3.29, P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed that, compared to the healthy controls, serum resistin levels were markedly higher in psoriasis patients in both Asian and Caucasian populations (Asians: SMD<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.27, 95%CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.62<U+2009>~<U+2009>4.91, P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; Caucasians: SMD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.91, 95%CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.28<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.54, P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001).

Evidence suggests that sleep is disrupted in psoriasis, however high quality empirical evidence is lacking. Given the importance of sleep for health, characterisation of sleep disruption in psoriasis is an important goal. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the sleep-psoriasis literature. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS and Web of Science from inception to May 2016. Studies were compared against inclusion/exclusion criteria and underwent a quality evaluation. Given the heterogeneity of studies, we conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings. Searches revealed 32 studies which met our predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Whilst 93.7% of studies reported sleep disruption in this population, ranging from 0.05% to 85.4%, many had important methodological shortcomings. Over half of all quantitative studies (54.8%; 17/31) relied on non-validated measures, contributing to heterogeneity in study findings. In those that employed valid measures, assessing sleep was often not the primary objective. We frequently found the absence of adequate sample size calculations and poor statistical reporting. This review showed that in psoriasis, reported sleep rates of sleep disturbance varied substantially. Most studies lacked a hypothesis driven research question and/or failed to use validated measures of sleep. We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the precise prevalence and nature of sleep disturbance within the psoriasis population.

Serum infliximab concentrations could therefore be related to the efficacy and tolerance of infliximab, and assist adjustment of treatment. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the value of measuring serum infliximab concentrations in psoriatic patients. A bibliographic search was performed on MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS for original studies on serum infliximab concentrations in psoriatic patients treated with infliximab. Ten articles were included, representing evaluation of serum infliximab concentrations in 733 patients. Predictive value of higher serum infliximab concentrations on long-term response maintenance was suggested in 3 studies. There was no information regarding the value of such measurements for adjustment of infliximab dosage. Trough serum infliximab concentrations that are at least detectable at steady state seem to be associated with maintained clinical response in the long term.;6908690;62029462469629;3388867;29;2014816;460;2976522875817;211;29;134;189817;74951571311167;90804;41;78315;20;4.5;9;35;7;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2735300;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;2;1;1;NA;1451993168;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.2340/00015555-1980;1412244687;1412121600;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;6;0;6;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2735300;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Systematic searches were performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases (1960 to December 2012) and proceedings from major relevant congresses (2010-2012) for controlled studies and randomised trials reporting confirmed CVEs in patients with RA or PsA/Pso treated with antirheumatic drugs. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed on extracted data. Out of 2630 references screened, 34 studies were included: 28 in RA and 6 in PsA/Pso. In RA, a reduced risk of all CVEs was reported with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (relative risk (RR), 0.70; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90; p=0.005) and methotrexate (RR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; p=0.007). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increased the risk of all CVEs (RR, 1.18; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38; p=0.04), which may have been specifically related to the effects of rofecoxib. Corticosteroids increased the risk of all CVEs (RR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.34 to 1.60; p<0.001). In PsA/Pso, systemic therapy decreased the risk of all CVEs (RR, 0.75; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; p=0.003). In RA, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and methotrexate are associated with a decreased risk of all CVEs while corticosteroids and NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk.

In recent years, publications on this topic have increased exponentially. To present a systematic, evidence-based update on the efficacy and safety of systemic treatments in paediatric psoriasis and to provide treatment recommendations, an update of the previous review was performed. PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register were searched between January 2007 and March 2014 for all available literature on efficacy and safety of all systemic treatments in paediatric psoriasis. The levels of evidence were determined on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. The newly retrieved evidence was combined with the evidence available in the former review. Fifty-two studies were included: 36 from the former review, plus 16 new articles. New evidence on induction therapy was mainly available on fumaric acid esters (FAEs), which are shown to be effective in a subgroup of patients. Long-term (96 weeks) safety and efficacy data on etanercept were found. Prospective studies are scarce. Most conclusions are formulated on studies with low level of evidence. Of the conventional systemic treatments, methotrexate still has the most evidence albeit in a low number of patients and with a low level of evidence. FAEs seem to be effective in a subgroup of patients, with gastro-intestinal complaints, flushes and temporary shifts in leucocyte counts and liver enzymes being the main side-effects. Etanercept has still accumulated most evidence of the available systematic treatments, with a large efficacy and reassuring safety profile in a 96-week follow-up.;6771968;61646290473641;2570945;60;4099920;1381;28917971014493;408;66;918;195278;74730067852335;65607;64;126082;93;36326086956522;26;69;65;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2805750;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;6;2;4;NA;1450199044;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12749;1414060024;1414022400;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;12;0;12;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=ttttffff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=ttttffff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=ttttffff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2805750;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Although increased prevalence and incidence of CV risk factors for atherosclerosis have been reported in psoriatic patients, psoriasis likely plays an independent role in the increased cardiovascular risk, presumably linked to the chronic systemic inflammatory state. Consistently, preliminary investigations suggest that anti-inflammatory therapies may improve early subclinical vascular alterations and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on ischemic CV involvement in psoriatic patients, summarizing the prevalence and incidence of CV risk factors and CV events, as well as evidence on mechanisms of premature atherosclerosis and on effects of systemic anti-inflammatory therapies on CV risk profile. We performed a systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and evaluated the quality of studies comparing drug treatments using Detsky score. Our review documented that psoriatic patients are at increased CV risk, related to raised prevalence and incidence of CV risk factor and to inflammatory status. However, available literature lacks of studies that establish appropriate targets for CV risk factors and assess the clinical value of screening for subclinical organ damage and the impact of disease-modifying therapies on CV risk profile in psoriatic patients. Awareness of raised CV risk in psoriatic patients should foster further research aimed at elucidating these aspects.;7902020;66891515940364;766861;89;7103559;3592;31483748259538;173;94;3412;237036;75616453350772;28040;87;208205;163;3135049382716;11;93;152;Mosca S;Gargiulo P;Balato N;Di Costanzo L;Parente A;Paolillo S;Ayala F;Trimarco B;Crea F;Perrone-Filardi P;Susanna Mosca;Paola Gargiulo;Nicola Balato;Luisa Di Costanzo;Antonio Parente;2957378;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;3;1;2;NA;1466007654;10;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;10;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.10.092;1417850217;1417651200;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;30;0;30;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=10&types=mmmmtttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=10&types=mmmmtttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=10&types=mmmmtttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2957378;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Yet, there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses that scientifically evaluated the pooled efficacy of these treatments in psoriasis. We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases during the period of January 1980 to June 2012. Our systematic search resulted in 765 studies, 23 of them were included in the review. The primary outcome was 75% reduction in severity score from baseline. A meta-analysis using random effect model found topical PUVA to be more effective than non-laser targeted UVB [odds ratio: 3.48 (95% confidence interval 0.56-21.84), P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.183]. The pooled effect estimate of the efficacy (75% reduction in severity score) of topical PUVA, targeted UVB, and PDT were as follows: 77% (topical PUVA), 61% (targeted UVB), and 22% (PDT). Topical PUVA and targeted UVB phototherapy are very effective in the treatment of localized psoriasis. Topical PUVA seems more effective than non-laser targeted UVB phototherapy. On the other hand, PDT has low efficacy and high percentage of side effects in treating localized psoriasis.;7464955;64819799958539;1760246;76;5689016;199;3677696969697;40;79;159;174023;73084796979695;44334;74;129158;8;72357142857143;4;50;4;Almutawa F;Thalib L;Heckman D;Sun Q;Hamzavi I;Lim HW;Almutawa, Fahad;Thalib, Lukman;Hekman, Daniel;Sun, Qing;Hamzavi, Iltefat;Lim, Henry W.;NA;NA;NA;2253176;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Other Physical Sciences;era;era;4;4;4;NA;1420803789;3.2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3.2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phpp.12092;1396642118;1385769600;dermatology;allergyandimmunology;Health Sciences;Medicine;Life Sciences;Immunology and Microbiology;0;21;0;21;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=4&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=4&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=4&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2253176;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Results were pooled and quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). With respect to PASI75, pooled risk ratios for infliximab (13.07, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 8.60-19.87), secukinumab (11.97, 95% CI 8.83-16.23), ustekinumab (11.39, 95% CI 8.94-14.51), adalimumab (8.92, 95% CI 6.33-12.57), etanercept (8.39, 95% CI 6.74-10.45), and apremilast (5.83, 95% CI 2.58-13.17) show superiority of biologics and apremilast in long-term therapy compared to placebo. With respect to the addressed safety parameters, no differences were seen between adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab versus placebo. No placebo-controlled data on conventional treatments was identified. Head-to-head studies showed superior efficacy of secukinumab and infliximab versus etanercept and of infliximab versus methotrexate. A clear ranking is limited by the lack of long-term head-to-head trials. From the available evidence, infliximab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab are the most efficacious long-term treatments. Data on conventionals are insufficient. Further head-to-head comparisons and studies on safety and patient-related outcomes are needed to draw more reliable conclusions.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 05 June 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.206.";7936934;67106933012983;615500;92;7319985;3104;63306587173703;173;94;2929;220652;83973350585314;24310;88;196273;99;11483428571429;12;87;87;Nast, Alexander;Jacobs, Anja;Rosumeck, Stefanie;Werner, Ricardo Niklas;Alexander Nast;Anja Jacobs;Stefanie Rosumeck;Ricardo N.

66;44;Systematic review on the maintenance of response during systemic antipsoriatic therapy;10.1111/bjd.14077;26280365;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4e93cf058f610002442;NA;NA;NA;British Journal of Dermatology;1;NA;As a chronic disease psoriasis often requires long-term treatment. Successful continuation of therapy during a maintenance phase is therefore important. A systematic review was performed on the efficacy of psoriasis drugs during maintenance treatment in patients, who had achieved a sufficient treatment success during induction period. Maintenance therapy is defined as the treatment period after successful induction therapy. (a) prospective studies with (b) systemic therapies recommended by the 2009 European psoriasis guidelines (plus ustekinumab), (c) study population that had achieved a defined treatment response criterion after induction therapy within a period of = 6 months. Maintenance studies on conventional treatments were identified for CSA only (no studies investigating acitretin, methotrexate, and ustekinumab were found). Compared to placebo, CSA was shown to be effective in maintenance therapy, yet CSA 1.5mg seems to be insufficient for maintaining disease control. Based on the evidence, it is uncertain whether there is any difference between daily or intermittent treatment. For biologics, maintenance data were available for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab. No differences in PASI75 response were identified between adalimumab 40mg once or twice a month. Continuous infliximab treatment was shown to be superior to as-needed treatment. For etanercept, only observational post-RCT data were available indicating a maintained PASI75 response in approximately three out of four patients during long-term treatment. Only limited evidence is available for a conclusion on how patients with an adequate response should be optimally treated during the maintenance period. A clear ranking of the available treatments is not yet possible. This article is protected by copyright.

67;45;Lack of association between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4+49A/G polymorphism and psoriasis and vitiligo: A meta-analysis of case-control studies.;10.1016/j.gene.2015.05.051;26013045;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932;NA;NA;NA;Gene;1;NA;Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a critical negative regulator of T-cell activation and proliferation. Several studies have assessed the association between CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism and psoriasis and vitiligo, but the results are inconsistent. This study was conducted to examine the association between CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism and psoriasis and vitiligo susceptibility. The PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched according to predefined criteria for all relevant studies published prior to July 3, 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and heterogeneity and publication bias tests were performed to estimate the strength of the association. Fourteen studies comprising six on psoriasis (700 cases, 781 controls) and eight on vitiligo (1514 cases, 2049 controls) were included. Overall, no significant association was detected between CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism and psoriasis. There was still no significant relationship when the studies were limited to ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian), HWE or heterogeneity, except the limitation to heterogeneity in the dominant (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.51-0.93, I(2)=0.0%) and additive (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.48-0.98, I(2)=0.0%) models, and the limitation to both heterogeneity and HWE in the dominant model (OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.48-0.98, I(2)=0.0%). Both overall and subgroup analyses based on ethnicity, genotype frequencies, and heterogeneity also failed to demonstrate an association between CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism and vitiligo. CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism may not contribute to psoriasis and vitiligo susceptibility, but further well-designed studies with large sample size are warranted to confirm this conclusion.;5570954;63320939207361;2930660;33;1873786;3872;24161141823818;2509;28;1088;192698;9254387406135;104528;35;69167;135;13074328358209;56;42;57;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4423508;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;1;1;NA;1440238563;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.05.051;1440238578;NA;NA;NA;Life Sciences;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology;NA;NA;0;8;0;8;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4423508;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Recently, susceptibility genes for Ps and PsA have been identified within the late cornified envelop (LCE) gene cluster, especially the cluster 3 (LCE3) genes. It is noteworthy that the deletion of LCE3B and LCE3C (LCE3C_LCE3B-del) is significantly associated with these two diseases. Gene-gene interactions between LCE3 genes and other genes are associated with Ps and PsA. LCE3 genes also have pleiotropic effect on some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Further studies need to focus on the potential function of LCE3 genes in the pathogenesis of Ps and PsA in the future.;6288077;58075355641343;2963554;30;1890188;200;19480703517588;84;46;93;162943;10028921923138;90266;34;55524;10;10388888888889;3;60;6;Changbing Shen;Jing Gao;Xianyong Yin;Yujun Sheng;Liangdan Sun;Yong Cui;Xuejun Zhang;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;3724050;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;2;1;1;NA;1441448463;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2015.01.001;1424776667;1424390400;NA;NA;Life Sciences;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology;NA;NA;0;11;0;11;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=3724050;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Dermatologists have an important role to screen psoriasis patients for PsA. The efficiency of PsA screening remains unknown. We sought to determine the point prevalence of undiagnosed PsA in patients with psoriasis using a systematic search of the literature and meta-analysis. PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase database searches yielded 394 studies for review. No study aimed to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed PsA in patients with psoriasis. We assumed that the prevalence of newly diagnosed PsA in patients with psoriasis at the time they seek medical care could be a sound estimate of this value. Seven epidemiological studies and 5 studies on PsA screening questionnaires allowed us to clearly identify patients with newly diagnosed PsA and were selected for review. The prevalence of undiagnosed PsA was 15.5% when all studies were considered and 10.1% when only epidemiological studies were considered. Data were obtained from studies not designed to address the question at hand. Heterogeneity was high (I(2) = 96.86%), and therefore a random effects model was used. The high prevalence of undiagnosed PsA in patients with psoriasis adds to the recommendation that dermatologists need to screen all patients with psoriasis for PsA.;8029773;68058472945396;285949;96;7743866;3325;76542033694344;124;96;3206;221779;82947363579797;11129;94;210634;47;24923043478261;6;87;41;Villani, Axel Patrice;Rouzaud, Marie;Sevrain, Morgane;Barnetche, Thomas;Paul, Carle;Richard, Marie-Aleth;Beylot-Barry, Marie;Misery, Laurent;Joly, Pascal;Le Maitre, Michel;Aractingi, Selim;Aubin, François;Cantagrel, Alain;Ortonne, Jean-Paul;Jullien, Denis;4156374;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;23;18;21;NA;1495112155;29.1;14;14;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;29.1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2015.05.001;1434327947;1420675200;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;45;0;45;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=30&types=mttttttf;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=30&types=mttttttf;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=30&types=mttttttf;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4156374;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Embase, CENTRAL, PubMed, AMED, CINAHL, CNKI, CQVIP, CBM, and Wanfang databases were searched from inceptions to May 2013 for prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating acupuncture therapies for psoriasis vulgaris. No language limitations were applied. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score. Six studies (involving 522 participants) met the eligibility criteria for this review, and 5 were included in quantitative analysis. Due to the diversity of interventions, comparators and reported outcomes, meta-analysis was not possible. Results from single studies produced conflicting results for the outcomes PASI reduction, lesion reduction (non-PASI), PASI score, and relapse rate. There is some evidence of benefit of acupuncture therapies for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. However, the conclusions are limited by the small number of included trials and conflicting results from single studies. More research is needed to clarify the effect of acupuncture therapies for psoriasis vulgaris. © 2015 S.

For some people, these conditions lead to psychological comorbidities and reduced quality of life (QoL). Patient education is recommended in the management of these conditions and may improve QoL. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of educational interventions to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Twelve electronic bibliographic databases, including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched to July 2014. Bibliographies of retrieved papers were searched and an Advisory Group contacted. Systematic reviews were conducted following standard methodologies. Clinical effectiveness studies were included if they were undertaken in people with a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Educational interventions that aimed to, or could, improve HRQoL were eligible. Studies were required to measure HRQoL, and other outcomes such as disease severity were also included. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials were eligible. For the review of cost-effectiveness, studies were eligible if they were full economic evaluations, cost-consequence or cost analyses. Seven RCTs were included in the review of clinical effectiveness. Two RCTs focused on children with eczema and their carers. Five RCTs were in adults. Of these, two were of people with psoriasis, one was of people with acne and two were of people with a range of conditions. There were few similarities in the interventions (e.g. the delivery mode, the topics covered, the duration of the education), which precluded any quantitative synthesis. Follow-up ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, samples sizes were generally small and, overall, the study quality was poor. There appeared to be positive effects on HRQoL in participants with psoriasis in one trial, but no difference between groups in another trial in which participants had less severe psoriasis. Carers of children in one RCT of eczema showed improvement in HRQoL; however, in a RCT evaluating a website intervention there were no demonstrable effects on HRQoL. Neither the RCT in those adults with acne nor the RCT in those adults with mixed skin conditions demonstrated an effect on HRQoL. One RCT reported subgroups with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis and education was effective for psoriasis only. Other outcomes also showed mixed results. It is unclear how clinically meaningful any of the observed improvements are. Three studies of cost-effectiveness were included. The interventions, comparators and populations varied across the studies and, overall, the studies provided limited information on cost-effectiveness. The studies did provide detailed information on resources and costs that could be useful to inform a future cost-effectiveness evaluation in this area. The application of the inclusion criterion around whether the interventions were aimed at improving HRQoL or the inference that they could improve HRQoL was difficult as information was rarely reported. There is uncertainty regarding whether educational interventions addressing issues that could improve HRQoL in people with chronic skin conditions are effective. Tentative conclusions about the best approach to delivering these kinds of interventions are that face-to-face, group, sessions may be beneficial; however, text messages may also be effective. Delivery over a period of time and by a multidisciplinary team may also be associated with positive outcomes. There is uncertainty over whether or not educational interventions are cost-effective.

A link between dermatological disorders like psoriasis and dyslipidemia has been established in the recent past. Many dermatological disorders could have a systemic inflammatory component which explains such association. Chronic inflammatory dermatological disorders could also have other metabolic imbalances that may contribute to dyslipidemia. Presence of such abnormal metabolism may justify routine screening of these disorders for associated dyslipidemia and other metabolic abnormalities and early treatment of such comorbidities to improve quality of life. Some of the drugs used by dermatologists such as retinoids are also likely to be a cause of dyslipidemia. Hence, it is imperative that the dermatologists obtain scientific knowledge on the underlying mechanisms involved in dyslipidemia and understand when to intervene with therapies. A systematic review of the English language literature was done by using Google Scholar and PubMed. In this review, attempts are made to list the dermatological disorders associated with dyslipidemia; to simplify the understanding of underlying mechanisms; and to give a brief idea about the interventions.";6892495;61874169550219;3378597;29;2011128;262;530569348659;97;44;116;300539;8965649355489;154280;37;113405;13;15208333333333;3;46;6;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4936909;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;1;1;NA;1451473936;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/1947-2714.168657;1451473963;1443657600;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;0;10;0;10;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4936909;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The aim of this study was to assess the risk of active tuberculosis (TB) in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases treated with biologics and tofacitinib in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and long-term extension (LTE) studies.Methods. A systematic review of the English-language literature by was performed by searching the Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Knowledge databases. The search strategy focused on synonyms of diseases, biologics and tofacitinib. Data from RCTs were combined to assess the rate of TB using a random effects model. The incidence rate (IR) of TB and its association with disease, location and treatment were assessed in LTE studies.Results. The search captured 11 130 articles and abstracts. One-hundred RCTs (75 000 patients) and 63 LTE studies (80 774.45 patient-years) met the inclusion criteria. There were 31 TB cases with TNF inhibitors, 1 with abatacept and none with rituximab, tocilizumab, ustekinumab or tofacitinib. The odds ratio for TNF inhibitors was 1.92 (95% CI 0.91, 4.03, P = 0.085). In LTE studies, the IR of TB was >40/100 000 with tofacitinib and all biologics except rituximab. IR was higher in RA patients with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies [307.71 (95% CI 184.79, 454.93)] than in those with rituximab [20.0 (95% CI 0.10, 60)] and etanercept [67.58 (95% CI 12.1, 163.94)] or AS, PsA and psoriasis with etanercept [60.01 (95% CI 3.6, 184.79)]. The IR of TB was higher in high-background TB areas.Conclusion. RCTs are not sensitive enough to assess the risk of reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Disease, treatment and background TB rate are associated with different frequencies of active TB. The benefit/risk balance of preventing reactivation of LTBI in different backgrounds should be considered in clinical practice.;4507652;51453542744813;926530;79;3564161;1566;37220268370607;335;77;1221;113815;79531500694117;27141;75;86309;40;53967692307692;6;85;34;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2610086;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Immunology;era;era;10;7;7;NA;1410630320;3.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keu172;1408494051;1400112000;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;46;0;46;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=4&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=4&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=4&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2610086;Public Health And Health Services;NA;NA;era;NA;NA

Recommendations may improve identification and treatment of comorbidities. The Canadian Dermatology-Rheumatology Comorbidity Initiative reviewed the literature to develop practical evidence-based recommendations for management of comorbidities in patients with RA, PsA, and PsO. Eight main topics regarding comorbidities in RA, PsA, and PsO were developed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1960-12/2012), together with abstracts from major rheumatology and dermatology congresses (2010-2012), were searched for relevant publications. Selected articles were analyzed and metaanalyses performed whenever possible. A meeting including rheumatologists, dermatologists, trainees/fellows, and invited experts was held to develop consensus-based recommendations using a Delphi process with prespecified cutoff agreement. Level of agreement was measured using a 10-point Likert scale (1 = no agreement, 10 = full agreement) and the potential effect of recommendations on daily clinical practice was considered. Grade of recommendation (ranging from A to D) was determined according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine evidence levels. A total of 17,575 articles were identified, of which 407 were reviewed. Recommendations were synthesized into 19 final recommendations ranging mainly from grade C to D, and relating to a large spectrum of comorbidities observed in clinical practice: CVD, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, infections, and cancer. Level of agreement ranged from 80.9% to 95.8%. These practical evidence-based recommendations can guide management of comorbidities in patients with RA, PsA, and PsO and optimize outcomes.;6946167;6227500795976;587458;91;6351161;1438;31046123869172;57;95;1378;208538;81873075857044;25755;87;182472;38;42773513513514;5;86;33;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4287419;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Immunology;era;era;6;4;5;NA;1468603808;11;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;11;http://dx.doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.141112;1437127873;1437170563;NA;NA;Health Sciences;Medicine;Life Sciences;Immunology and Microbiology;0;45;0;45;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=11&types=mmtttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=11&types=mmtttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=11&types=mmtttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4287419;Public Health And Health Services;NA;NA;era;NA;NA

We set out to analyse systematically the efficacy and tolerability of approved treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of systemic treatment approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of participants with 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at primary efficacy measurement (week 8-16). Safety was summarized as rates of adverse events and withdrawals. Direct and indirect comparative efficacy was assessed by random effects meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs). In total, 48 eligible RCTs totalling 16 696 patients (11 178 randomized to biologics, 1888 to conventional treatments) were identified. In placebo-controlled trials, infliximab was the most efficacious [RD 76%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 73-79%]. Adalimumab (RD 61%, 95% CI 56-67%), and ustekinumab 45 mg (RD 63%, 95% CI 59-66%) and 90 mg (RD 67%, 95% CI 60-74%) each had similar efficacy. These biologics are more effective than etanercept and all conventional treatments. Head-to-head trials indicate the superiority of adalimumab and infliximab over methotrexate (MTX), the superiority of ustekinumab over etanercept, the nonsignificant superiority of ciclosporin over MTX, and the dose-dependent efficacy of etanercept and ustekinumab. Fumaric acid is as efficacious as MTX. Safety of treatments could not be pooled due to a lack of standardization in reporting across trials. In conclusion, the qualitative and quantitative evidence is much stronger for biological interventions than for conventional treatments.;6713246;61608598324636;2805161;55;3755217;2988;50244934717107;1507;45;1352;137629;68498156915746;50919;60;82679;33;56574375;14;48;16;Schmitt, J.;Rosumeck, S.;Thomaschewski, G.;Sporbeck, B.;Haufe, E.;Nast, A.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1834850;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;4;4;4;NA;1382426897;1.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12663;1381975277;1356998400;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;65;0;65;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1834850;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
107;61;Psoriasis and Smoking: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.;10.1111/bjd.12670;24117435;One more reason to stop smoking- Psoriasis!! A horrible disease. #AttiliBytes;February 2014 - Articles of the Month: 'Psoriasis and smoking: meta-analysis' #BJD;Referencia consultada en inglés 3/n;NA;NA;4f6fa4e93cf058f610002442;1365-2133;0007-0963;70963;British Journal of Dermatology;3;NA;Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease associated with increased cardiovascular comorbidity. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and prior studies have suggested that patients with psoriasis are more likely to be active smokers. Smoking may also be a risk factor in the development of psoriasis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of smoking among patients with psoriasis, and we reviewed the contribution of smoking to the incidence of psoriasis. A total of 25 prevalence and three incidence studies were identified. The meta-analysis of prevalence studies included a total of 146 934 patients with psoriasis and 529 111 patients without psoriasis. Random effects meta-analysis found an association between psoriasis and current smoking [pooled odds ratio (OR) 1·78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·52-2·06], as well as between psoriasis and former smoking (pooled OR 1·62, 95% CI 1·33-1·99). Meta-regression analysis did not reveal any sources of study heterogeneity, but a funnel plot suggested possible publication bias. A subset of studies also examined the association between moderate-to-severe psoriasis and smoking, with a pooled OR of 1·72 (95% CI 1·33-2·22) for prevalent smoking. The three incidence studies found an association between smoking and incidence of psoriasis, with a possible dose-effect of smoking intensity and duration on psoriasis incidence. These findings suggest that smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of psoriasis, and that patients with established psoriasis continue to smoke more than patients without psoriasis.;8038089;68236667777181;1669634;79;6357665;3597;53544488320356;629;82;2963;143243;70440154563607;30260;78;112753;36;53482285714286;3;91;33;A W Armstrong;C T Harskamp;J S Dhillon;E J Armstrong;Armstrong, A.W.;Harskamp, C.T.;Dhillon, J.S.;Armstrong, E.J.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1826685;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;5;5;5;NA;1496999911;4.35;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;4.35;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12670;1381831776;1381449600;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;41;0;41;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=5&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=5&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=5&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1826685;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Nine studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The comparisons were with placebo and/or anti-psoriatic pharmacotherapy (APP) with two studies having three arms. The pooled meta-analysis data indicated the topical herbal formulae improved overall clinical efficacy (defined as 50% improvement or greater) when compared with: topical placebo (plus oral herbal co-intervention); topical APP alone; and topical APP (plus pharmaceutical co-intervention). Improvement was evident in Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score when topical herbal formula was compared to placebo (plus oral herbal co-intervention). No serious adverse events were reported. The most commonly used herbs were Sophora flavescens root and Lithospermum erythrorhizon root.

112;66;Is there a psoriasis skin phenotype associated with psoriatic arthritis? Systematic literature review.;10.1111/jdv.12562;24985559;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f63;1468-3083;0926-9959;NA;Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology;3;NA;Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is associated with psoriasis with a prevalence varying from 5.94% to 23.9%. The aim of this study was to assess if some psoriatic skin features are associated with a higher risk of PsA. A systematic literature search was carried out from 1980 to January 2013, in the Embase and Pubmed databases, using a combination of keywords including (Psoriasis) AND (PsA). Of the 2746 articles retrieved, 25 references were selected. Meta-analysis was performed when possible. Mean age at psoriasis onset appeared to be similar among patients with skin disease alone and in those with PsA. There was no clinical type of psoriasis specifically associated with PsA, including pustular psoriasis of palms and soles. Nonetheless specific psoriasis localizations were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing PsA in one cohort study: scalp lesions [Hazard Ratio (HR) 3.89 (95% confidence interval (CI):2.18-6.94)] and intergluteal/perianal lesions [HR 2.35 (95%CI:1.32-4.19)]. A similar association was found in two cross-sectional studies. Nail involvement was significantly associated with PsA in the meta-analysis [Odds Ratio (OR) 2.92 (95% CI 2.34-3.64)], particularly onycholysis [OR 2.38 (95% CI 1.74-3.26)]. Moreover, nail psoriasis was also associated with distal interphalangeal joint arthritis. The extent of psoriasis appeared to be associated with PsA in one cohort study [=3 sites: HR 2.24 (95% CI 1.23-4.08)], one case-control study [body surface area >75%: OR 2.52 (95% CI 1.33-4.75)] and three cross-sectional studies. The meta-analysis suggested a trend for an association between high PASI and PsA risk [mean difference 3.39 (95% CI 0.94-5.83)]. Therefore, psoriasis patients with such clinical features may require a particular attention for early and close detection of PsA during the course of the cutaneous disease.;7896890;66848881279648;3357674;56;4426490;1561;34014756410256;508;63;995;177624;73573557703678;60189;64;114348;38;17067567567568;7;78;30;M Rouzaud;M Sevrain;A P Villani;T Barnetche;C Paul;M-A Richard;D Jullien;L Misery;M Le Maître;S Aractingi;F Aubin;P Joly;A Cantagrel;J-P Ortonne;M Beylot-Barry;2487827;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;3;3;NA;1481889457;2;0.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12562;1404642539;1406851200;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;2;0;2;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2487827;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This review evaluates the effects of oral CHM in combination with pharmacotherapy for psoriasis vulgaris. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CNKI, and CQVIP were searched from their inceptions to November 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating CHM plus pharmacotherapy compared to pharmacotherapy were included. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.1.0. Seventeen RCTs were included, conducted in China, and employed a diversity of both herbal medicines and pharmacotherapies. When the meta-analyses were restricted to studies that used a well-known pharmacotherapy as the comparator with 60% or greater clinical improvement in psoriasis as the outcome, five studies used oral acitretin, one used topical calcipotriol, and one used topical clobetasol propionate as control interventions. At the end of treatment, there was a benefit for the pooled result of the five studies that compared CHM plus acitretin with acitretin alone and no serious adverse events were reported. However, none of these studies was blind, so there is considerable risk of bias in this result. In addition, there was inadequate reporting of longer-term results, so it remains unclear whether the reported effect could be maintained or whether the prolonged use of the CHM in conjunction with acitretin would be safe. The main plants used in these studies, Rehmannia glutinosa root, Salvia miltiorrhiza root, and Lithospermum erythrorhizon root, have shown anti-inflammatory and/or antiproliferative effects in experimental studies. These actions may at least partially explain the observed results.;7917108;66979661075636;3161863;59;4698551;1549;32576524547804;602;60;937;188574;77028999803792;58934;67;128014;56;16541818181818;10;78;44;Zhang CS;Yu JJ;Parker S;Zhang AL;May B;Lu C;Xue CC;Zhang, Claire Shuiqing;Yu, Jason Jingjie;Parker, Shefton;Zhang, Anthony Lin;May, Brian;Lu, Chuanjian;Xue, Charlie Changli;NA;2680763;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Public Health And Health Services;era;era;5;4;5;NA;1466373588;2.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijd.12607;1410604875;1410303600;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;12;0;12;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=ttttttff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=ttttttff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=ttttttff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2680763;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
120;70;Methotrexate and liver fibrosis in people with psoriasis: A systematic review of observational studies.;10.1111/bjd.12941;24606161;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4e93cf058f610002442;1365-2133;0007-0963;NA;British Journal of Dermatology;3;NA;Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for psoriasis but concerns regarding the development of liver fibrosis prevent optimal use. The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess whether MTX use increases the risk of developing fibrosis in people with psoriasis. Searches were performed on Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Database and Clinical Trials Register from inception until September 2013 for studies including at least two liver biopsies in people with psoriasis. Double extraction using predefined data fields was performed. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies were considered. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5. Quality of observational studies was assessed using a study quality bias checklist. Eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 429 patients). The pooled risk difference (RD) of developing significant liver fibrosis was 0·09 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0·03 to 0·20]. The RD for developing 'any fibrosis' was 0·22 (95% CI 0·04-0·41). The RD for cirrhosis was 0·04 (95% CI 0·02-0·07). There was no clear association between cumulative dose of MTX and fibrosis. Obesity, diabetes and alcohol use were under-reported. The quality of the included studies was weak and the degree of selection bias means the results are not generalizable to all patients with psoriasis taking MTX. High-quality, population-based studies that consider potential confounders common in psoriasis population are justified for better prediction of the subset of patients at risk of liver fibrosis.

122;72;The Prevalence and Odds of Depressive Symptoms and Clinical Depression in Psoriasis Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.;10.1038/jid.2013.508;24284419;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0e;NA;NA;NA;Journal of Investigative Dermatology;2;NA;"The reported prevalence of depression in psoriasis varies substantially. This study aims to determine the prevalence and odds of depressive symptoms and clinical depression in psoriasis. A systematic literature search was conducted. Mean questionnaire values and proportions for depressive symptoms and clinical depression were pooled according to different assessment methods. In controlled studies, standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratio (OR) compared depression in psoriasis patients with controls using the random-effect model. The majority of the 98 eligible studies were conducted in tertiary centers without a control group. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 28% using questionnaires and the prevalence of clinical depression was 12% using International Classification of Diseases codes, 19% using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, and 9% for antidepressant use. Psoriasis patients had significantly more depressive symptoms (SMD 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.66), and population-based studies showed that they were at least one and a half times more likely to experience depression (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.40-1.76) and used more antidepressants than did controls (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.53-11.76). More than 10% of psoriasis patients suffer from clinical depression, and twice as many have depressive symptoms. The high prevalence of these symptoms is likely to be affected by the tertiary study populations and differential misclassification using questionnaires, where psoriasis-related symptoms may be detected as depressive symptoms.";4507509;51386389830674;2124958;49;2232326;2426;45347579381443;1384;40;977;121043;71583575948847;51661;53;64468;46;14833333333333;14;67;31;Emmilia A Dowlatshahi;M Wakkee;Lidia R Arends;Tamar Nijsten;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1943240;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;3;2;2;NA;1405101314;1.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jid.2013.508;1385723264;1385510400;NA;NA;Health Sciences;Medicine;Life Sciences;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology;0;20;0;20;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1943240;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Databases searched were Pubmed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register. All studies reporting on the prevalence of onychomycosis in nail psoriasis were obtained, and quality assessment was determined by the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology checklist. Literature search revealed 720 studies, of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. The major limitation of the review was the heterogeneity of the included studies, which prevented the possibility to conduct a meta analysis. However, the average prevalence of 18.0% of onychomycosis in psoriatic patients seems to be increased when compared with control groups and literature on healthy population, even though the ultimate evidence remains lacking. As in the literature hypothesized shift in causative agents from dermatophytes to yeasts and/or moulds could not be confirmed. The clinical consequence of the relatively high prevalence of onychomycosis in psoriasis may be a general advice to rule out onychomycosis or concomitant onychomycosis in these patients with (suspected) nail psoriasis. This advice is stressed by the relative simplicity of treating the contribution of onychomycosis in the nail dystrophy but also the fact that nail psoriasis mostly is treated by immunosuppressive drugs, like steroids, methotrexate or biologics which may aggravate mycotic nail infections.;6291064;59790049322357;2061717;66;4203906;1091;28337027522936;250;76;834;103850;78015500775164;31661;68;71524;16;12666666666667;3;81;13;Klaassen, K.M.G.;Dulak, M.G.;Kerkhof, P.C.M.;Pasch, M.C.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1697094;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;7;4;4;NA;1418666707;2.85;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.85;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12239;1376926593;1376870400;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;12;0;11;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1697094;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

131;79;A Systematic Review of Systemic Medications for Pustular Psoriasis in Pediatrics.;10.1111/pde.12351;24890463;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ac;NA;NA;NA;Pediatric Dermatology;1;NA;There is lack of information and evidence-based studies on the treatment of pediatric pustular psoriasis. Previous reports have emphasized the limitations of the existing data and encouraged the exploration of therapy optimization through more structured research. The objective of the current study was to perform a systematic review of systemic interventions for pediatric pustular psoriasis with an emphasis on clinical response and treatment outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Embase databases from 1982 to 2012. Of 632 references identified, 14 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. A cohort of eight patients from the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, was also included. Information was limited to systemic treatments in children. Only English- and Spanish-language articles were included. Information was gathered from 24 patients, 22 of whom (92%) presented with generalized pustular psoriasis and 2 (8%) with acral distribution. The mean age at presentation was 6.3 ± 4.9 years. More than one intervention was required in 12 (50%) cases. The most common therapies used for generalized pustular psoriasis were acitretin, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. We identified that there is lack of information regarding long-term response to systemic drugs because the data were focused on treatment initiation. Treatment of pustular psoriasis in pediatrics is challenging. Although acitretin, methotrexate, and cyclosporine seem to control generalized pustular psoriasis within 3 months of therapy initiation, information on long-term follow-up is lacking. Furthermore, physicians may encounter difficulties after discontinuing or tapering medications.;5090501;60303787922621;2689346;34;1737528;630;18935771065183;257;40;255;125653;7906197720689;61645;38;48350;7;0.7916666667;2;28;2;Claudia J Posso-De Los Rios;Elena Pope;Irene Lara-Corrales;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2402633;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;1;1;NA;1431425856;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pde.12351;1401876555;1401321600;dermatology;pediatrics;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;19;0;19;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2402633;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

A previously published review was lacking comprehensive data on biologics. Therefore, a systematic literature review was performed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the economic burden of psoriasis throughout the world. Studies published in the English language between January 2001 and May 2013 reporting the direct and indirect economic burden of psoriasis were identified from PubMed and conference proceedings. Thirty-five studies from 11 countries met the inclusion criteria. In 2004, the annual total cost (direct and indirect) in the USA alone was approximately US$1.40 billion. Among the European countries, the most recent studies reported an annual total cost per patient of €11,928 in Sweden, €8372 in Italy, €2866-6707 in Germany and CDN$7999 in Canada, based on treatment type.

Physicians need to be aware of the current evidence concerning these products. This review evaluates the efficacy and safety of preparations of plant extracts used topically for psoriasis. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, two Chinese databases and article reference lists. Randomized controlled trials investigating extracts of single plants were included. Preparations of multiple plants and combinations of plant extracts plus conventional therapies were excluded. Two authors conducted searches, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes used in meta-analyses were: clinical efficacy, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, and quality of life and symptom scores. The 12 included studies investigated extracts of: Mahonia aquifolium (n = 5), Aloe vera (n = 3), indigo naturalis (n = 2), kukui nut oil (n = 1) and Camptotheca acuminata nut (n = 1). Methodological quality was variable. Six studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis of clinical efficacy, and five were vs. placebo (relative risk 3·37, 95% confidence interval 1·36-8·33). Experimental studies indicate components of indigo naturalis, Mahonia and Camptotheca have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and other actions of relevance to psoriasis. The clinical trial evidence provides limited support for preparations containing extracts of M. aquifolium, indigo naturalis and Aloe vera for the topical management of plaque psoriasis based on multiple studies. No serious adverse events were reported. Because of the small size of most studies and methodological weaknesses, strong conclusions cannot be made. The magnitudes of any effects cannot be measured with accuracy, so it is difficult to assess the clinical relevance of these preparations.;6307487;59759522849522;2240224;63;4027780;2336;46032368308351;962;57;1352;101576;76927129510215;34527;65;66299;39;21473684210526;8;76;30;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1671854;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;5;4;4;NA;1401275800;2.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12557;1375783395;1375401600;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;34;0;34;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1671854;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We critically evaluate 14 cohorts and meta-analyze the magnitude of CVD risk for the primary outcomes of CVD mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI), and establish subgroup risk for different psoriasis severities and age groups. Increased CVD risk was identified only in individuals with severe psoriasis (defined as requiring systemic therapy or hospital admission): the risk ratio relative to the general population was 1.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.60) for CVD mortality, 3.04 (95% CI 0.65-14.35) for MI, and 1.59 (95% CI 1.34-1.89) for stroke. The relative risks of CVD were highest in the younger, severe psoriasis population (e.g., 3.10 (95% CI 1.98-4.86) for MI at 30 years), and absolute risks were greatest in older individuals with severe psoriasis (e.g., 23.2 excess MIs per 10,000 person-years at 60 years). Uncertainty remains about whether CVD risk is directly attributable to psoriasis, as the majority of studies failed to adequately adjust for key traditional risk factors.;4681163;56987966927893;1872702;59;2774117;2349;49120621805792;1258;45;1074;91355;73580197035708;31171;64;59354;81;2804725;21;74;60;Eleanor J Samarasekera;Julie M Neilson;Richard B Warren;Jill Parnham;Catherine H Smith;Samarasekera EJ;Neilson JM;Warren RB;Parnham J;Smith CH;Eleanor J.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand the association between psoriasis and hypertension. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register from 1 January 1980 to 1 January 2012. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. We applied the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines in the conduct of this study. We identified 24 observational studies with a total of approximately 2.7 million study participants fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Among them, 309<U+200A>469 were patients with psoriasis. On the basis of random effects modeling of case-control and cross-sectional studies, the odds ratio (OR) for hypertension among patients with psoriasis was 1.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-1.76] compared with the controls. The OR for hypertension among patients with mild psoriasis was 1.30 (95% CI 1.15-1.47) and the OR for hypertension among patients with severe psoriasis was 1.49 (95% CI 1.20-1.86) compared with the controls. Two cohort studies examining incidence of hypertension found that psoriasis was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05-1.14) and 1.17 (95% CI 1.06-1.30) for development of hypertension. In a subgroup analysis, patients with psoriatic arthritis also had an increased prevalence of hypertension (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.41-3.04). Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are associated with greater prevalence of hypertension.

Phototherapy has been proven effective for psoriasis, but side effects have become a concern. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) bath combined with phototherapy has been used in clinical settings, but the additional benefit requires evaluation. This review aims to evaluate the additional benefit and safety of adding CHM bath to phototherapy for psoriasis vulgaris. Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and CQVIP were searched from their inceptions to 6 August 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHM bath plus phototherapy to phototherapy alone for psoriasis vulgaris were included. Data was analyzed using Review Manager 5.1.0. Thirteen RCTs were included in the review, and eight were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed higher efficacy of CHM bath plus phototherapy when compared with phototherapy alone in terms of PASI 60 (RR 1.25; 95% CI: 1.18-1.32). Mild adverse events were reported in ten studies, but these could be alleviated by reducing UV dosage or applying emollient. In conclusion, CHM bath appears to be a beneficial and safe adjunctive therapy to phototherapy for psoriasis vulgaris. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the low methodological quality of the included studies.";4507280;51336924524522;1713656;61;2756886;2941;33559469387755;766;72;2143;90474;75636804792592;30141;65;59525;27;3521;8;70;19;Yu, Jason Jingjie;Yu JJ;Zhang CS;Zhang AL;May B;Xue CC;Lu C;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1648475;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;4;4;NA;1377822650;2.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/673078;1374746668;1356998400;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;11;0;11;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1648475;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We set out to determine whether systemic inflammation is elevated in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy controls, and to measure the extent of this elevation, by summarizing available data on serum inflammatory markers. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 2011. We included studies comparing the serum inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a in patients with psoriasis and healthy controls. Differences in serum marker levels between patients and controls were pooled as standardized mean differences (SMDs; Cohen's d) using a random-effects model. Seventy-eight studies were eligible. Of the 7852 individuals included, 3085 had (severe plaque) psoriasis. The pooled SMDs were higher in patients with psoriasis than in healthy controls for IL-6 [d = 1·32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·83-1·81], CRP (d = 1·83, 95% CI 0·76-2·90), TNF-a (d = 1·32, 95% CI 0·86-1·79), E-selectin (d = 1·78, 95% CI 1·32-2·25) and ICAM-1 (d = 1·77, 95% CI 1·15-2·39). The SMD between cases and controls for IL-1ß and IL-10 was not significant. Age had a significant effect on the SMD for IL-6 and TNF-a. For IL-6 the effect size was higher for plaque psoriasis studies (d = 1·98). The effect size was not influenced by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, measurement method or quality assessment. The pooled analyses suggest modest but significantly elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of patients with psoriasis with predominantly severe disease. To what extent this modest increment is clinically relevant could be investigated in a synthesis of all studies measuring inflammation before and after antipsoriatic therapy.";4507509;51386389830674;2300013;35;1608639;2588;38765875531504;1302;35;924;107083;79420645673412;53248;35;37633;65;521828125;26;36;24;Dowlatshahi EA;van der Voort EA;Arends LR;Nijsten T;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2239460;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;1;1;1;NA;1394747605;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12355;1396585755;1365206400;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;56;0;56;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2239460;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
157;94;Psoriasis, cardiovascular events, cancer risk and alcohol use: evidence-based recommendations based on systematic review and expert opinion.;10.1111/jdv.12162;23845148;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f63;1468-3083;0926-9959;NA;Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology;1;1;The relationship between psoriasis, chronic inflammation, cardiovascular risk and risk of cancer has long been debated. In addition, it has been suggested that alcohol consumption may be a risk factor for psoriasis onset and severity. The aim of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations on the risk of comorbidities and its management for daily clinical use, focusing on cardiovascular risk, risk of cancer and alcohol use in psoriasis. A scientific committee identified and selected through the Delphi method clinically relevant questions about cardiovascular risk, risk of cancer and alcohol use in psoriasis. To address these questions, a systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases. Systematic literature reviews including meta-analysis whenever possible were performed. Subsequently, an Expert board meeting involving 39 dermatologists took place to analyse the evidence and to elaborate recommendations on the selected questions. Recommendations were graded according to the Oxford level of evidence grading system. The degree of agreement of these recommendations was assessed on a 10-point scale, as well as their potential impact on daily clinical practice. A total of 3242 articles were identified through the systematic literature searches, among which 110 were included in the systematic reviews. Overall, 12 recommendations were elaborated regarding comorbidities management in psoriasis patients. A moderate increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly myocardial infarction (MI) [meta-analysis of cohort studies: OR = 1.25 (95% CI 1.03-1.52) and of cross-sectional studies: OR = 1.57 (95% CI 1.08-2.27)], and coronary artery disease (CAD) [meta-analysis of cross-sectional: OR = 1.19 (95% CI 1.14-1.24), of cohort studies: OR = 1.20 (95% CI 1.13-1.27) and of case-control studies: OR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.09-3.09)] was acknowledged. This increased cardiovascular risk requires appropriate prevention measures. There was a lack of substantial evidence that conventional systemic treatment has any effect on cardiovascular risk although methotrexate might be cardioprotective. An increased risk of solid cancer potentially associated with smoking and alcohol use was identified. The role of systemic treatment on cancer risk could not be assessed thoroughly due to limited long-term follow-up data. A higher risk of non-melanoma skin cancers especially squamous cell carcinoma was shown, mainly due to previous exposure to oral 8-methoxypsoralen-ultraviolet-A (PUVA), ciclosporin and possibly methotrexate. No firm conclusion could be drawn regarding alcohol and psoriasis due to high variability in alcohol usage assessment in studies. Clinical experience suggests higher alcohol consumption among psoriasis patients compared to the general population. The mean expert participants' level of agreement on these recommendations varied from 6.8 to 9.4. These 12 recommendations are evidence based and supported by a panel of expert dermatologists. The next step is now to disseminate these recommendations to dermatologists who did not participate in the Expert board meeting and to assess their opinion about the recommendations.;6393536;59814393821254;1182016;81;5204059;1234;28196561232766;113;90;1120;92033;79428014603616;20689;77;71182;24;41978260869565;4;83;20;Richard, M.-A.;Barnetche, T.;Horreau, C.;Brenaut, E.;Pouplard, C.;Aractingi, S.;Aubin, F.;Cribier, B.;Joly, P.;Jullien, D.;Le Maître, M.;Misery, L.;Ortonne, J.-P.;Paul, C.;NA;1630225;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;6;2;3;NA;1391055797;4.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;4.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12162;1374056195;1375315200;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;19;0;19;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=5&types=tttttwww;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=5&types=tttttwww;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=5&types=tttttwww;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1630225;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The aim of this study was to evaluate if there is an increase in the background risk of cancer in psoriasis patients compared with the general population. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases, using the keywords 'Psoriasis [Majr] AND Neoplasms', from 1980 to January 2012. Meta-analysis was performed based on observational studies showing consistency in cancer risk assessment methods. Of the 1080 articles retrieved, 37 references were selected. There may be an increased risk of some solid cancers in psoriasis: respiratory tract cancer [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.71], upper aerodigestive tract cancer (SIR = 3.05, 95% CI 1.74-5.32), urinary tract cancer (SIR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55) and liver cancer (SIR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.48-2.44). The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma appears slightly increased in psoriasis (SIR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.86). Psoriasis patients have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SIR = 5.3, 95% CI 2.63-10.71) and basal cell carcinoma (SIR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.83-2.20), whereas the risk of melanoma is not increased. There was a large heterogeneity in studies assessing cancer risk in psoriasis preventing from including all studies in meta-analysis. This systematic literature review shows a small increased risk of some solid cancers in psoriasis, especially those linked to alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking. A higher risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, especially squamous cell carcinoma, is shown, mainly due to previous exposure to 8-methoxypsoralen-ultraviolet-A (PUVA), ciclosporin and possibly methotrexate.;4507280;51336924524522;2304453;35;1595200;1169;17651164383562;478;43;514;81021;79476270797336;40904;34;28243;17;1815625;6;52;9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1630224;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;2;1;1;NA;1384340888;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12165;1374056176;1375315200;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;10;0;10;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1630224;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

An increase in CV morbidity and mortality attributable to psoriasis is still under question. Primary objective: to assess CV morbidity and mortality in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) including stroke, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI) and peripheral artery disease. Secondary objectives: to assess if psoriasis per se is an independent CV risk factor and if psoriasis severity is a predictor of CV risk. We also evaluated the effect of conventional systemic treatments for psoriasis on CV mortality. A systematic literature search was carried out from 1980 to December 2011, in the Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library databases, in English and French using a combination of keywords including (Psoriasis) OR (Psoriatic arthritis) AND (Myocardial infarction) OR (Coronaropathy) OR (Stroke) OR (Cardiovascular) AND (Methotrexate) AND (Ciclosporin) AND (Retinoids). Of the 929 identified references, 33 observational studies evaluating the rates of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with psoriasis and PsA compared with controls were selected. Meta-analysis of both cohort and cross-sectional studies showed an increased risk of MI with Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.25 (95% CI 1.03-1.52) and 1.57 (95% CI 1.08-2.27) in psoriasis and PsA, respectively, compared with the general population. The risk of MI was more pronounced for patients having severe psoriasis and for patients with psoriasis of early onset. It remained significantly elevated after controlling for major CV risk factors. The meta-analysis identified a small, but significant association between psoriasis, PsA and coronary artery disease with an OR between 1.19 (95% CI 1.14-1.24) for cross-sectional studies, 1.20 (95% CI 1.13-1.27) for cohort studies and 1.84 (95% CI 1.09-3.09) for case-control studies. The risk of coronary artery disease seemed to be more pronounced in patients with severe psoriasis and in patients with psoriasis of early onset. The meta-analysis assessing the risk of stroke gave inconclusive results: analysis of cross-sectional studies suggested that psoriasis patients had a slightly higher risk of stroke with an OR of 1.14 (95% CI 1.08-1.99), whereas the meta-analysis of cohort studies failed to show an association. There was also an increased risk of peripheral artery disease in psoriasis. No significant increased risk of CV mortality could be shown for both psoriasis and PsA patients. The use of methotrexate was associated with a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease in two studies. The use of etretinate was associated with a reduction of CV mortality in one study. Potential selection bias such as the 'healthy user effect' prevents from drawing definite conclusions. There may be a small, but significant increased risk of CVE, but not of CV mortality in psoriasis and PsA patients. The psoriasis attributable risk remains difficult to assess due to confounding factors. The moderate quality of CV risk factors reporting in studies should be acknowledged. In addition, heterogeneity in study design, outcome definition and assessment represent major limitations. Nevertheless, screening and management of CV risk factors are important in psoriasis.;7534762;65107844469081;1281539;82;6246970;1486;33698666666667;153;89;1330;113336;70808590285438;20109;82;93131;24;42239130434783;3;87;21;Horreau, C.;Pouplard, C.;Brenaut, E.;Barnetche, T.;Misery, L.;Cribier, B.;Jullien, D.;Aractingi, S.;Aubin, F.;Joly, P.;Maître, M.;Ortonne, J.-P.;Paul, C.;Richard, M.-A.;NA;1630223;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;12;9;9;NA;1460413840;5.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;5.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12163;1374056172;1375315200;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;54;0;54;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=6&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=6&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=6&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1630223;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess whether alcohol consumption is more prevalent in psoriasis patients than in the general population and whether alcohol consumption is a risk factor of psoriasis. A systematic literature search was carried out in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases using the keywords 'psoriasis' AND 'alcohol drinking' OR 'alcohol-related disorders'. The search was then enlarged with the keywords 'psoriasis' AND 'risk factor' OR 'comorbidity'. Altogether 911 references in English and French were found. Out of these, 837 articles were excluded by reading the abstract and 46 by reading the article. A total of 28 articles were selected. Alcohol consumption in psoriasis patients versus the general population: 23 studies were selected; 18 concluded that alcohol consumption was more prevalent in psoriasis patients, and 5 did not. Three studies compared the prevalence of excessive drinking using a questionnaire on alcohol dependence (CAGE or Self-administered alcohol screening test (SAAST)) or with quantitative criteria for excessive drinking. In these studies, excessive drinking was more prevalent among psoriasis patients than in the general population. Other articles studied the quantity and type of alcohol consumed. In 11 studies, psoriasis patients consumed more alcohol than the controls. Four other studies showed excessive alcohol consumption in psoriasis patients without control group comparison. Conversely, five studies identified no difference in alcohol consumption between psoriasis patients and the general population. The heterogeneity in the measurement of alcohol consumption did not allow performing meta-analysis. Alcohol as a risk factor for psoriasis: only five studies were selected. In four of these studies alcohol was found to be a risk factor for psoriasis. Alcohol consumption seems to be greater in psoriasis patients than in the general population. However, there is not enough evidence to establish whether alcohol consumption is indeed a risk factor for psoriasis.";7909849;66937446400934;409769;94;7497034;1566;33999693290735;23;98;1543;124151;68867919774468;7665;93;116451;23;46818181818182;2;91;21;Brenaut E;Horreau C;Pouplard C;Barnetche T;Paul C;Richard MA;Joly P;Le Maître M;Aractingi S;Aubin F;Cribier B;Jullien D;Ortonne JP;Misery L;Brenaut, E.;1619552;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;7;4;6;NA;1495143002;19;14;7;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;19;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12164;1373580499;1356998400;dermatology;sexuallytransmitteddiseases;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;23;0;23;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=19&types=mmmttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=19&types=mmmttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=19&types=mmmttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1619552;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

One of the most robust genetic findings is the association of variants in the IL12B gene with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This study aims to assess whether combined evidence shows the association between IL12B polymorphisms and the susceptibility to psoriasis/PsA. We conducted a systematic review to examine the association between the IL12B rs3212227 (1188A > C) and rs6887695 and psoriasis/PsA. In addition, we used studies for which combined information from all genotypes was available to compare risks in dominant and recessive model. Potential publication bias was evaluated by Egger's linear regression test. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and contributed data to the meta-analyses. For rs3212227, the odds ratios the minor allele for psoriasis and PsA were 0.688 (95 % CI 0.650-0.729) and 0.707 (95 % CI 0.628-0.797), respectively. Then, for rs6887695, the pooled ORs were 0.704 (95 % CI 0.670-0.739) for psoriasis and 0.677 (95 % CI 0.599-0.767) for PsA. The overall ORs for all genotypes of rs3212227 and rs6887695 were all significantly associated with psoriasis. No publication bias was presented. Taken together, our results demonstrate a significant association between IL12B gene polymorphisms and psoriasis and PsA.;4506837;5127001515923;2324819;34;1546256;602;26585391014975;293;36;221;107075;79217359583093;54110;32;34556;37;81472222222222;23;27;10;Zhu KJ;Zhu CY;Shi G;Fan YM;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2244803;1.5.4;FALSE;Medicine & Public Health;Rheumatology;springer;springer;1;1;1;NA;1391187563;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00296-012-2637-4;1396599182;1357776000;NA;NA;Health Sciences;Medicine;Life Sciences;Immunology and Microbiology;0;22;0;22;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2244803;Clinical Sciences;NA;NA;era;NA;NA

170;103;Etanercept provides an effective, safe and flexible short- and long-term treatment regimen for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: a systematic review of current evidence.;10.3109/09546634.2012.713462;22812568;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fbc;NA;NA;NA;Journal of Dermatological Treatment;2;NA;The treatment of psoriasis requires long-lasting intervention. Conventional treatments for psoriasis comprise topical, phototherapeutic and systemic modalities, such as methotrexate or cyclosporine. Biological therapies are advocated by treatment guidelines for the use in moderate-to-severe psoriasis, when conventional treatments have failed, are contraindicated or are associated with severe adverse events. Etanercept is an anti-TNF recombinant fusion protein that has emerged as a standard biologic treatment option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The present review summarizes data from pivotal and post-marketing randomized controlled etanercept trials to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis for 24 weeks and longer. During the first 12 weeks, etanercept can be administered in different dosing regimens: 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) and 50 mg once weekly. Although both regimens are effective, it has been shown that the 50 mg BIW dosage leads to higher response rates at week 24. In addition, after 24 weeks' treatment etanercept provides the unique possibility of continuous or intermittent long-term treatment programmes. The medium- to long-term efficacy of etanercept was consistent, regardless of whether etanercept therapy was interrupted or continuous. Taking the chronic nature of psoriasis into account, this flexibility in dosing regimen bestows a key advantage in facilitating individualisation of long-term treatment according to patient needs.;4507280;51336924524522;1989504;53;2419769;293;17370890410959;69;73;214;80654;54150051207023;30891;58;47337;16;0.88;4;75;12;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1060346;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;2;2;2;NA;1371636482;1.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09546634.2012.713462;1352606779;1342915200;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;2;0;2;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1060346;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We set out to summarize evidence on the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability of different topical treatments used in plaque psoriasis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trial data of U.K.-licensed topical therapies. The primary outcome was clear or nearly clear status stratified for (i) trunk and limbs; and (ii) scalp. Network meta-analyses allowed ranking of treatment efficacy. In total, 48 studies were available for trunk and limb psoriasis, and 17 for scalp psoriasis (22,028 patients in total); the majority included people with at least moderate severity psoriasis. Strategies containing potent corticosteroids (alone or in combination with a vitamin D analogue) or very potent corticosteroids dominated the treatment hierarchy at both sites (trunk and limbs, scalp); coal tar and retinoids were no better than placebo. No significant differences in achievement of clear or nearly clear status were observed between twice- and once-daily application of the same intervention or between any of the following: combined vitamin D analogue and potent corticosteroid (applied separately or in a single product), very potent corticosteroids, or potent corticosteroids (applied twice daily). Investigator and patient assessment of response differed significantly for some interventions (response rates to very potent corticosteroids: 78% and 39%, respectively). No significant differences were noted for tolerability or steroid atrophy, but data were limited. In conclusion, corticosteroids are highly effective in psoriasis when used continuously for up to 8 weeks and intermittently for up to 52 weeks. Coal tar and retinoids are of limited benefit.

Searches were conducted in September 2012 of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, two Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese Scientific Journals Full Text Database) and of article reference lists. We included randomized controlled trials published in English, Chinese or Japanese that investigated topical HM combined with APP used systemically and/or topically compared to pharmacotherapy alone. Studies employing phototherapy were excluded. Two authors conducted searches, extracted data on study characteristics and outcomes, and assessed Risk of Bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. All used multi-herb formulae, four in herbal baths, three in herbal ointments or creams, and one as herbal steam. The pooled data indicated a benefit for the add-on effect of herbal therapy to APP. Adding these topical HMs to conventional pharmacotherapy appeared to produce short-term additional clinical benefits. No serious adverse events were reported. Experimental studies suggest that some of the herbs possess anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and/or anti-proliferative activities. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution due to methodological weaknesses and the lack of replicated studies. Studies that address the identified methodological deficiencies are required to further investigate the efficacy and safety of these HMs as adjunct therapies for psoriasis.;7571218;65337981331095;1463133;80;6101852;419;24407511961722;29;92;389;296958;66589515721131;64514;78;232058;7;1.2;1;85;6;Shiqiang Deng;Brian H.

This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence for the association between psoriasis and dyslipidaemia. Through a systematic search using MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register, from 1 January 1980 to 1 January 2012, we identified 25 observational studies that met the inclusion criteria. These 25 studies included over 2·4 million participants, among whom 265,512 were patients with psoriasis. Twenty studies (80%) reported that psoriasis was significantly associated with dyslipidaemia, with odds ratios (ORs) for dyslipidaemia ranging from 1·04 to 5·55 in 238,385 patients with psoriasis, from a population of 2,340,605 participants. Specifically, four studies defining dyslipidaemia as triglyceride levels = 150 mg dL reported significantly increased ORs of 1·20-4·98 for hypertriglyceridaemia in psoriasis. Three studies found that patients with psoriasis presented with significantly increased ORs (1·36-1·77) for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels < 40 mg dL , and two studies found hyperlipoproteinaemia to be significantly elevated in patients with psoriasis (ORs 1·55 and 2·09). One cohort study found a significantly higher incidence of hyperlipidaemia among patients with psoriasis (hazard ratio 1·17; 95% confidence interval 1·11-1·23). Among studies that assessed the severity of psoriasis, in 2662 patients with mild psoriasis and 810 patients with severe psoriasis, higher odds of dyslipidaemia were seen in patients with severe psoriasis. Five of the 25 studies (20%) in our review did not show any significant relationship between psoriasis and dyslipidaemia. This systematic review found that psoriasis was significantly associated with greater odds and incidence of dyslipidaemia. Greater psoriasis severity appeared to be associated with higher prevalence of dyslipidaemia.";7012143;62595048756829;1123434;83;5884245;3091;50440090614887;407;86;2679;101018;56186075611036;16132;83;84816;17;2.6;3;82;14;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1027242;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;9;8;8;NA;1377087284;5.7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;5.7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12101;1351387425;1325376000;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;24;0;24;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=6&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=6&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=6&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1027242;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

To better understand this, we performed a systematic review of published population-based studies on the incidence and prevalence of psoriasis. Three electronic databases were searched from their inception dates to July 2011. A total of 385 papers were critically appraised; 53 studies reported on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis in the general population. The prevalence in children ranged from 0% (Taiwan) to 2.1% (Italy), and in adults it varied from 0.91% (United States) to 8.5% (Norway). In children, the incidence estimate reported (United States) was 40.8/100,000 person-years. In adults, it varied from 78.9/100,000 person-years (United States) to 230/100,000 person-years (Italy). The data indicated that the occurrence of psoriasis varied according to age and geographic region, being more frequent in countries more distant from the equator. Prevalence estimates also varied in relation to demographic characteristics in that studies confined to adults reported higher estimates of psoriasis compared with those involving all age groups. Studies on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis have contributed to a better understanding of the burden of the disease. However, further research is required to fill existing gaps in understanding the epidemiology of psoriasis and trends in incidence over time.";7953275;67183323059095;336521;95;7616507;3112;63258225650916;80;97;3032;102036;57821057480277;3898;96;98135;79;32694358974359;2;97;77;Parisi R;Symmons DP;Griffiths CE;Ashcroft DM;Rosa Parisi;Deborah P M Symmons;Christopher E M Griffiths;Darren M Ashcroft;Deborah P.M.

Optimal use of psoriasis treatments can limit the physical manifestations of psoriasis and help improve quality of life, but nonadherence is common. Smoking, obesity and excessive alcohol consumption are prevalent in this population. A systematic review of adherence to medication and recommendations for lifestyle change in psoriasis was undertaken, with a critical appraisal of the quality of the selected studies. Electronic searches from inception to March 2012 (PubMed, Web of Science and Embase) were conducted. Twenty-nine studies were included; however, none examined adherence to advice about lifestyle change. Studies using a dichotomous classification of adherence tended to report suboptimal adherence, with 21·6-66·6% of patients classed as adherent. No consistent pattern of results emerged for sociodemographical, disease and lifestyle factors as determinants of adherence. However, some treatment factors were associated with adherence. While mixed findings were reported for quality of life as a determinant of adherence, psychological factors (psychological distress and patient satisfaction with care and therapy) were associated with adherence. Only tentative conclusions can be made for determinants of adherence because the methodological quality of many of the included studies limits conclusions. There is a need for improved quality of research and reporting in this area, and this review provides a platform from which future research within this area should progress, along with suggested research recommendations.";7099316;62990871854507;802696;88;6294588;3184;50209764373233;294;90;2890;292054;64821704690587;40231;86;251716;216;4027488372093;14;93;202;Thorneloe RJ;Bundy C;Griffiths CE;Ashcroft DM;Cordingley L;Thorneloe, R.J.;Bundy, C.;Griffiths, C.E.M.;Ashcroft, D.M.;Cordingley, L.;R.J.

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizing the epidemiological associations between psoriasis and obesity.Data sources:We searched for observational studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register from 1 January 1980 to 1 January 2012. We applied the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines in the conduct of this study.Study selection:We identified 16 observational studies with a total of 2.1 million study participants (201<U+2009>831 psoriasis patients) fulfilling the inclusion criteria.Results:Using random-effects meta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for obesity among patients with psoriasis was 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-1.89) compared with those without psoriasis. From the studies that reported psoriasis severity, the pooled OR for obesity among patients with mild psoriasis was 1.46 (95% CI 1.17-1.82) and the pooled OR for patients with severe psoriasis was 2.23 (95% CI 1.63-3.05). One incidence study found that psoriasis patients have a hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI 1.14-1.23) for new-onset obesity.Conclusions:Overall, compared with the general population, psoriasis patients have higher prevalence and incidence of obesity. Patients with severe psoriasis have greater odds of obesity than those with mild psoriasis.;5036385;59659709716306;532622;89;4496478;132;16383969465649;43;67;89;285048;61367082130313;35515;87;249176;10;33473111111111;5;50;5;Armstrong AW;Harskamp CT;Armstrong EJ;A W Armstrong;C T Harskamp;E J Armstrong;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1119713;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;15;15;15;NA;1396050769;9.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;9.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nutd.2012.26;1355318840;1354752000;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;0;4;0;70;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=10&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=10&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=10&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1119713;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

197;122;Placebo response in relation to clinical trial design: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials for determining biologic efficacy in psoriasis treatment.;10.1007/s00403-012-1266-9;22843024;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4e83cf058f610002301;NA;NA;NA;Archives of Dermatological Research;1;NA;There is a need to better define how the efficacy of investigational drugs is affected by study design, implementation, and placebo responses in randomized controlled trials. The improvements observed in placebo groups within trials examining psoriasis treatments may be partially due to study design and implementation. We conducted a systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of biologics in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis to evaluate rates of placebo and active drug responders to determine specific factors within study design that may contribute to placebo responses. We included randomized, placebo-controlled trials of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, ustekinumab, alefacept, and efalizumab that utilized Psoriasis Area Severity Index as an outcomes measure. We compared the rates of the placebo treatment arm versus the active drug arm achieving 75 % improvement of Psoriasis Area Severity Index. 31 trials involving 8285 active treatment and 3999 placebo patients were included. Rates of placebo responders (4.14 %) were significantly lower than active drug responders (48.4 %). The overall odds ratio calculated was 23.94 (p < 0.0001, 95 % CI 16.02-35.76). Binomial regression models showed that treatment indication, randomization fraction, a PASI inclusion requirement, and the time period of outcomes measure documentation affect placebo responses. Placebo responses seen in randomized controlled trials evaluating biologics in the treatment of psoriasis are not likely due to a physiologic mechanism, but may be secondary to chronic disease course and factors of clinical trial design and implementation.;4507144;51294364809111;2310673;35;1579708;341;20611;174;37;128;89523;73207505641073;45519;34;30468;13;0.7291666667;3;61;8;Lamel SA;Myer KA;Younes N;Zhou JA;Maibach H;Maibach HI;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1573679;1.5.4;FALSE;Dermatology;Medicine & Public Health;springer;springer;2;1;1;NA;1371810002;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00403-012-1266-9;1371809892;1343779200;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;1;19;0;20;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1573679;Clinical Sciences;NA;NA;era;NA;NA
199;123;A Systematic Review of Systemic Medications for Pustular Psoriasis in Pediatrics.;10.1111/pde.12351;24890463;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ac;NA;NA;NA;Pediatric Dermatology;1;NA;There is lack of information and evidence-based studies on the treatment of pediatric pustular psoriasis. Previous reports have emphasized the limitations of the existing data and encouraged the exploration of therapy optimization through more structured research. The objective of the current study was to perform a systematic review of systemic interventions for pediatric pustular psoriasis with an emphasis on clinical response and treatment outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Embase databases from 1982 to 2012. Of 632 references identified, 14 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. A cohort of eight patients from the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, was also included. Information was limited to systemic treatments in children. Only English- and Spanish-language articles were included. Information was gathered from 24 patients, 22 of whom (92%) presented with generalized pustular psoriasis and 2 (8%) with acral distribution. The mean age at presentation was 6.3 ± 4.9 years. More than one intervention was required in 12 (50%) cases. The most common therapies used for generalized pustular psoriasis were acitretin, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. We identified that there is lack of information regarding long-term response to systemic drugs because the data were focused on treatment initiation. Treatment of pustular psoriasis in pediatrics is challenging. Although acitretin, methotrexate, and cyclosporine seem to control generalized pustular psoriasis within 3 months of therapy initiation, information on long-term follow-up is lacking. Furthermore, physicians may encounter difficulties after discontinuing or tapering medications.;5090501;60303787922621;2689346;34;1737528;630;18935771065183;257;40;255;125653;7906197720689;61645;38;48350;7;0.7916666667;2;28;2;Claudia J Posso-De Los Rios;Elena Pope;Irene Lara-Corrales;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2402633;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;1;1;NA;1431425856;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pde.12351;1401876555;1401321600;dermatology;pediatrics;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;19;0;19;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2402633;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Physicians need to be aware of the current evidence concerning these products. This review evaluates the efficacy and safety of preparations of plant extracts used topically for psoriasis. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, two Chinese databases and article reference lists. Randomized controlled trials investigating extracts of single plants were included. Preparations of multiple plants and combinations of plant extracts plus conventional therapies were excluded. Two authors conducted searches, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes used in meta-analyses were: clinical efficacy, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, and quality of life and symptom scores. The 12 included studies investigated extracts of: Mahonia aquifolium (n = 5), Aloe vera (n = 3), indigo naturalis (n = 2), kukui nut oil (n = 1) and Camptotheca acuminata nut (n = 1). Methodological quality was variable. Six studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis of clinical efficacy, and five were vs. placebo (relative risk 3·37, 95% confidence interval 1·36-8·33). Experimental studies indicate components of indigo naturalis, Mahonia and Camptotheca have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and other actions of relevance to psoriasis. The clinical trial evidence provides limited support for preparations containing extracts of M. aquifolium, indigo naturalis and Aloe vera for the topical management of plaque psoriasis based on multiple studies. No serious adverse events were reported. Because of the small size of most studies and methodological weaknesses, strong conclusions cannot be made. The magnitudes of any effects cannot be measured with accuracy, so it is difficult to assess the clinical relevance of these preparations.;6307487;59759522849522;2240224;63;4027780;2336;46032368308351;962;57;1352;101576;76927129510215;34527;65;66299;39;21473684210526;8;76;30;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1671854;1.5.4;FALSE;Clinical Sciences;Oncology And Carcinogenesis;era;era;5;4;4;NA;1401275800;2.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12557;1375783395;1375401600;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;34;0;34;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1671854;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

290;144;Systematic review of comparative efficacy and tolerability of calcipotriol in treating chronic plaque psoriasis.;10.1136/bmj.320.7240.963;10753146;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c;0959-8138;9598138;1468-5833;British Medical Journal;NA;NA;To evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of topical calcipotriol in the treatment of mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis. Quantitative systematic review of randomised controlled trials. 6038 patients with plaque psoriasis reported in 37 trials. Mean difference in percentage change in scores on psoriasis area and severity index, and response rate ratios for both patients' and investigators' overall assessments of marked improvement or better. Adverse effects were estimated with the rate ratio, rate difference, and number needed to treat. Calcipotriol was at least as effective as potent topical corticosteroids, calcitriol, short contact dithranol, tacalcitol, coal tar, and combined coal tar 5%, allantoin 2%, and hydrocortisone 0.5%. Calcipotriol caused significantly more skin irritation than potent topical corticosteroids (number needed to treat to harm for irritation 10, 95% confidence interval 6 to 34). Calcipotriol monotherapy also caused more irritation than calcipotriol combined with a potent topical corticosteroid (6, 4 to 8). However, the number needed to treat for dithranol to produce lesional or perilesional irritation was 4 (3 to 5). On average, treating 23 patients with short contact dithranol led to one more patient dropping out of treatment owing to adverse effects than if they were treated with calcipotriol. Calcipotriol is an effective treatment for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, more so than calcitriol, tacalcitol, coal tar, and short contact dithranol. Only potent topical corticosteroids seem to have comparable efficacy at eight weeks. Although calcipotriol caused more skin irritation than topical corticosteroids this has to be balanced against the potential long term effects of corticosteroids. Skin irritation rarely led to withdrawal of calcipotriol treatment. Longer term comparative trials of calcipotriol versus dithranol and topical corticosteroids are needed to see whether these short term benefits are mirrored by long term outcomes such as duration of remission and improvement in quality of life.;8014601;67724523976199;1994062;61;4922974;33571;22730732022639;18977;29;9955;178893;11495926167744;55909;67;121153;756;49826413245033;524;28;217;Ashcroft, D M;Po, A L;Williams, H C;Griffiths, C E;Darren M Ashcroft;Alain Li Wan Po;Hywel C Williams;Christopher E M Griffiths;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;20889534;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;NA;1;NA;1467825523;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.320.7240.963;1496857653;955152000;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;13;0;13;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=dddddddd;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=dddddddd;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=dddddddd;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=20889534;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The association between alcohol consumption and psoriasis has been inconsistent among studies. To examine the magnitude of the risk of developing psoriasis for drinking populations compared to those with non-drinking, and to determine causes of the variation in odds ratios (OR) between various case-control studies, we performed a comprehensive published work search and a meta-analysis of case-control studies considering prevalence. We did electronic searches on Medline, and searched reports to identify case-control studies of prevalent of psoriasis. We did meta-analyses of study-specific incremental estimates to determine the risk of psoriasis associated with drinking. The magnitude of the OR was analyzed by combining 15 case-control studies that matched defined criteria. The variance in OR between studies was explored. The overall OR of psoriasis for drinking persons compared to those with non-drinking was 1.531 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.164-2.014, P = 0.002) and the association remains statistically significant across a number of stratified analyses in European descent subgroup (OR = 1.432, 95% CI = 1.085-1.889, P = 0.011) and also persists in sensitivity analyses performed to assess the potential effect of varying psoriasis outcome definitions. Alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of psoriasis.

Systematic reviews (SR) have the potential of identifying psychometrically sound measures in a given therapeutic area, whilst guiding the development of practice guidelines. The aim of this SR was to generate evidence of the use of QoL instruments in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for interventions in psoriasis. The methodology followed PRISMA guidelines. Six databases were searched with 388 search terms. Abstracts of articles were reviewed independently by two assessors, a third adjudicator resolved any opinion differences. Risk of bias was assessed using the JADAD scale. Of 3646 screened publications, 99 articles (100 trials) met eligibility criteria for inclusion, describing research on 33,215 subjects. 33 trials tested topical therapy, 18 systemic, 39 biologics, 9 phototherapy and 10 tested other interventions. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was the most commonly used QoL instrument (number of studies=83, 83%), followed by the Short Form-36 (SF-36) (31, 31%), EuroQoL (EQ-5D) (15, 15%), Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) (14,14%) and Skindex (5, 5%). There was widespread inconsistency in the way that QoL data was reported. Of the 100 trials identified, 37 reported Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID); 32 were for DLQI, 10 for SF-36 and six for EQ-5D. QoL measurement is increasingly being reported in RCTs of psoriasis. Formal guidelines are needed for assessment and publishing of QoL data. Researchers should consider whether MCID information is available, and development of MCID data should be encouraged. This article is protected by copyright.

306;149;A systematic review on methods used to evaluate patient preferences in psoriasis treatments;10.1111/jdv.13749;27431827;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f63;1468-3083;9269959;NA;Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology;1;NA;In the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, recently approved medications undergo the 'early benefit assessment' in Germany. Psoriasis treatments differ in a multiplicity of characteristics like side-effects, beneficial effect, cost and process attributes, which serve to evaluate the patient-relevant benefit compared to standard treatments. Patient preferences might help to aggregate the various patient-relevant outcomes into a single measure. In this context, besides the calculation of the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) refers to methods of multi-criteria decision making or preference evaluation like analytic hierarchy process and conjoint analysis. The objective was to give an overview of methods that have been used in international published studies to evaluate patient preferences in psoriasis treatments. The review is based on a systematic literature research on December 2014 in selected electronic databases, using the keywords 'psoriasis' and 'preferences' as well as the name of specific methods, known from the literature to evaluate patient preferences. The search resulted 389 hits without duplicates. 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Depending on the study objective, preferences were elicited for health states, health state domains, treatment attributes or treatment alternatives focusing on different outcomes of preferences. Thereby, different methods were used in included studies. For this reason, there is no single outcome available that might be useful in the benefit assessment of the IQWiG. Willingness-to-pay, often included as part of a conjoint analysis, was the predominant method to elicit preferences. So far, the analytic hierarchy process has not been used in psoriasis studies. The use of this method in future studies might provide new essential knowledge in the evaluation of patient preferences in psoriasis treatments. However, a clear assignment when to use which method is not given by the IQWiG and should be prioritized.;7842929;66456183517125;4107465;27;2185676;1551;341584;782;28;442;255660;11840071673596;140764;34;88626;91;3155;42;28;26;Gutknecht, M;Schaarschmidt, M-L;Herrlein, O;Augustin, M;M.

307;150;Adherence, satisfaction and preferences for treatment in patients with psoriasis in the European Union: a systematic review of the literature;10.2147/ppa.s117006;27895471;#Adherence, satisfaction and preferences for treatment in patients with #psoriasis in the European Union;#Adherence, satisfaction and #preferences for treatment in patients with #psoriasis in the EU;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc71;NA;NA;NA;Patient preference and adherence;2;NA;Adherence to treatment in patients with psoriasis is often poor. An investigation of patient preferences and satisfaction with treatment may be important, based on the expected correlation with therapy compliance. This paper aims to examine and describe the current literature on patient preferences, satisfaction and adherence to treatment for psoriasis in the European Union (EU). Electronic searches were conducted using PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Spanish databases and Google Scholar. European studies published in English or Spanish between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014 regarding patient-reported outcomes in psoriatic patients were included. Studies conducted in non-EU countries, letters to the editor, editorials, experts' opinions, case studies, congress proceedings, publications that did not differentiate between patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis or studies related to specific treatment were excluded. A total of 1,769 titles were identified, of which 1,636 were excluded as they were duplicates or did not provide any relevant information. After a full-text reading and application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 46 publications were included. This paper will describe publications on adherence (n=4), preferences (n=5) and satisfaction with treatment (n=7). Results related to health-related quality of life articles (n=30) have been published elsewhere. Adherence rates are generally low in psoriasis patients regardless of the type of treatment, severity of disease or methods used to measure adherence. Biologic therapy is associated with greater clinical improvement. There is a direct association between physician recommendations, patient preferences and several domains of treatment satisfaction. The results of this review support the conclusion that adherence rates in patients with psoriasis are suboptimal and highlight the need to improve patient compliance and satisfaction with treatment. Patients' preferences should be taken into account in the treatment decision-making process in order to improve patients' clinical outcomes by ensuring satisfaction and adherence.;7851688;66523167403332;3082831;60;4743818;763;43074829396325;253;66;508;252800;12111392173228;92997;62;158398;51;10715;13;74;38;I Belinchón;R Rivera;C Blanch;M Comellas;L Lizán;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;13799173;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;7;5;5;NA;1481056117;2.7;2.7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.7;http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s117006;1479492931;1479340800;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;0;12;0;12;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=13799173;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
308;151;Biosimilars for the Treatment of Chronic Inflammatory Diseases: A Systematic Review of Published Evidence;10.1007/s40259-016-0201-6;27885553;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c9;NA;NA;NA;BioDrugs;2;NA;"Clinicians are required to assimilate, critically evaluate, and extrapolate information to support appropriate use of biosimilars across indications. The objective of this study was to systematically collate all published data in order to assess the weight (quantity and quality) of available evidence for each molecule and inform and support healthcare decision-making in chronic inflammatory diseases. MEDLINE(®), EMBASE(®), and ISI Web of Science(®) were searched to September 2015. Selected conference proceedings were searched from 2012 to July 2015. Studies disclosing biosimilars with unique identifiers were categorized by originator, study type, and indication. Risk of bias assessments were performed. Intended copies were differentiated as commercially available agents without evidence of rigorous comparative biosimilarity evaluations. Proposed biosimilars for adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, and rituximab are reported in the published literature. Across indications, approved biosimilars infliximab CT-P13, SB2, and etanercept SB4 have published studies involving the largest number of patients or healthy subjects (n = 1405, 743, and 734, respectively), mostly in rheumatoid arthritis. At data cut-off, only CT-P13 had published data in ankylosing spondylitis (n = 250; randomized control trial) and ulcerative colitis/Crohn's disease (n = 336; observational studies). Published data were not available for ongoing studies in psoriasis patients. Four intended copies were identified in published studies (total: n = 1430; n = 1372 in observational studies). Thematic analysis of non-empirical publications showed that indication extrapolation remains an issue, particularly for gastroenterologists. While most agents display a moderate to high degree of similarity to their originator in the published studies identified, large discrepancies persist in the overall amount and type of data available in the public domain. Significant gaps exist particularly for intended copies, reinforcing the need to maintain a clear differentiation between these molecules and true biosimilars.";7856296;6655704591281;3620815;53;4204088;173;31544651162791;88;49;85;250950;12283196689367;116763;52;132482;5;36375;3;40;2;Ira Jacobs;Danielle Petersel;Leah Isakov;Sadiq Lula;K.

309;152;Cancer Recurrence Following Immune-suppressive Therapies in Patients With Immune-mediated Diseases: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis;10.1053/j.gastro.2016.03.037;27039969;#Cancer Recurrence Following #Immune-Suppressive Therapies;#Gastro meta-analysis details cancer recurrence in patients with immune-mediated diseases;AmerGastroAssn: #Gastro meta-analysis details cancer recurrence in patients with immune-mediated diseases;Strong immune drugs don't seem to cause more #cancer in people who had disease before.;NA;4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fe;1528-0012;165085;NA;Gastroenterology;10;2;"Physicians frequently encounter patients with immune-mediated diseases and a history of malignancy. There are limited data on the safety of immunosuppressive therapy for these patients. Published studies have been small with few events, precluding robust estimates of risk. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and conference proceedings for terms related to immune mediated disease, immune-suppressive therapy, and cancer recurrence from inception to April 2015. We included 16 studies (9 of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 8 of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and of patients with psoriasis) and stratified studies by type of immune-suppressive therapy (monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF], conventional immune-modulatory agents, or no immune suppression). A random effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled incidence rates as well as risk differences between the various treatments. Our analysis included 11,702 persons contributing 31,258 person-years (p-y) of follow up after a prior diagnosis of cancer. Rates of cancer recurrence were similar among individuals receiving anti-TNF therapy (33.8/1000 p-y), immune-modulator therapy (36.2/1000 p-y), or no immunosuppression (37.5/1000 p-y), but were numerically higher among patients receiving combination immune suppression (54.5/1000 p-y) (P>.1 for all). Subgroup analysis of new and recurrent cancers separately, type of immune-modulator therapy, or immune-mediated disease revealed similar results, with no increase in risk. We found similar pooled incidence values for new or primary cancers when immunosuppression was initiated within 6 years (33.6/1000 p-y for immune-modulatory agents and 43.7/1000 p-y for anti-TNF agents) vs more 6 years after the index cancer (32.9/1000 p-y for immune-modulatory agents; P=.86 and 21.0/1000 p-y for anti-TNF agents; P=.43) CONCLUSION: In a meta-analysis of 16 studies, we observed similar rates of cancer recurrence among individuals with prior cancer who received no immunosuppression, anti-TNF therapy, immune-modulator therapy, or combination treatments. Prospective studies are needed to ascertain optimal intervals for re-initiation of immune suppressive therapies for individuals with specific cancers.";8010338;67659809933044;37542;99;7973076;5010;78190281493312;26;99;4984;277348;11194050269157;3013;98;274335;175;22524126436782;7;96;168;Edward Shelton;David Laharie;Frank I.

PASI 90 response denotes better clinical improvement compared to PASI 75. Very few studies have assessed if a greater PASI clinical response is associated with greater improvements in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between PASI response and DLQI. The study was conducted to assess whether greater improvement in PASI scores from PASI 75-89 to PASI 90 is associated with greater Quality of life (QoL) improvements, specifically DLQI scores. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library to identify studies evaluating biologic interventions in adult moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients reporting PASI response and their corresponding DLQI change from baseline score. The quality of evidence was assessed through Jadad score for randomized controlled trials and Downs and Black's checklist for observational studies. Meta-analysis estimated change from baseline in DLQI for PASI 75-89 responders to be 78% (95% credible intervals [CrI]: 75-82%) and for PASI 90 responders to be 90% (95% CrI: 88-93%). This implies 12% greater improvement in DLQI score for PASI 90 responders compared with PASI 75-89 responders. In addition, the meta-analysis also showed a statistically significant difference in DLQI score of 0/1 between PASI 75-89 and PASI 90 responders (45% [95% Crl]; 41.0-50.0% and 73% [95% Crl]; 70.0-76.0%), respectively, Bayesian P < 0.0001). In conclusion, substantial improvement in clinical efficacy is associated with improved QoL in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis suggesting that PASI 90 responders (clear or almost clear skin) could achieve a superior QoL compared to PASI 75-89 responders.";7902020;66891515940364;4143484;27;2203646;1563;33992010243278;787;28;447;182789;11597253298904;97438;37;68126;41;184625;18;31;13;L.

311;154;Comparative risk of harm associated with the use of targeted immunomodulators- A systematic review;10.1002/acr.22815;26663412;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Arthritis care & research;1;NA;To systematically compare the risk of adverse events (AEs) for 13 targeted immunomodulators (TIMs) indicated for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), inflammatory bowel diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We searched electronic databases through July 2015 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing AEs between two or more TIMs head-to-head. We reported on the following outcomes: number of AEs, discontinuation due to AEs, serious AEs, mortality, serious infections, tuberculosis, herpes zoster, and malignancies. We qualitatively synthesized the literature and conducted random effects meta-analyses if three or more studies provided data for an outcome. Ten head-to-head RCTs and 51 observational studies were included in this systematic review. A majority of the studies (70%) were conducted in RA patients. Risk of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was higher with infliximab than with adalimumab or etanercept in RA, PsA, and AS. A higher risk for serious infections was noted with infliximab than with abatacept, adalimumab, or etanercept in RA. Risk for treatment discontinuation due to AEs, serious infections, and tuberculosis was lower with etanercept than with adalimumab in RA. Limited evidence suggested no comparative differences in risk for mortality, malignancies, and herpes zoster for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab in RA. Important differences were noted in the safety profile of TIMs in RA, generally favoring abatacept, adalimumab, and etanercept over infliximab. Head-to-head comparative evidence for other TIMs and non-RA populations was insufficient to draw conclusions for most of the safety outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

Growing evidence shows that an active component of turmeric, curcumin, may be used medically to treat a variety of dermatologic diseases. This systematic review was conducted to examine the evidence for the use of both topical and ingested turmeric/curcumin to modulate skin health and function. The PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched for clinical studies involving humans that examined the relationship between products containing turmeric, curcumin, and skin health. A total of 234 articles were uncovered, and a total of 18 studies met inclusion criteria. Nine studies evaluated the effects of ingestion, eight studies evaluated the effects of topical, and one study evaluated the effects of both ingested and topical application of turmeric/curcumin. Skin conditions examined include acne, alopecia, atopic dermatitis, facial photoaging, oral lichen planus, pruritus, psoriasis, radiodermatitis, and vitiligo. Ten studies noted statistically significant improvement in skin disease severity in the turmeric/curcumin treatment groups compared with control groups. Overall, there is early evidence that turmeric/curcumin products and supplements, both oral and topical, may provide therapeutic benefits for skin health. However, currently published studies are limited and further studies will be essential to better evaluate efficacy and the mechanisms involved.;7987814;67359164730015;46699;99;7941489;1331;56960661654135;5;99;1326;270812;11455781862627;3785;98;267027;21;40375;1;95;20;Vaughn, Alexandra R;Branum, Amy;Sivamani, Raja K;Vaughn, Alexandra R.;Sivamani, Raja K.;Alexandra R.

International electronic databases and gray literature were searched to identify studies conducted on patient-reported outcomes in patients with psoriasis, published in Europe between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Bibliographic references were hand-searched. Editorials, letters, commentaries, opinion papers, and studies related to specific treatments were excluded. A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria, 27 of them reporting data related to HRQoL or its conditioning factors. The publications reviewed highlighted the substantial negative impact of psoriasis on patients' HRQoL. Most of the studies that analyzed the relationship between HRQoL and sociodemographic characteristics described a relation between gender (female) and age (young patients) and poorer HRQoL. An association between HRQoL impairment and visibility of skin lesions and disease activity and severity was also established. Skin discomfort and pruritus were identified as elements that negatively influenced HRQoL. Use of biological agents had a positive impact on HRQoL and on treatment satisfaction, a better HRQoL being seen in patients treated with systemic therapies and biologics. HRQoL has been broadly addressed in patients with psoriasis in Europe. Several disease- and patient-related factors contributed to its deterioration. Therapeutic measures with proven effectiveness in controlling disease symptoms and reducing PASI should be considered in patients with a severe disease who have a poorer HRQoL.;7554544;65226894405088;3454178;52;3930509;1153;33745920138889;515;50;588;266295;11385274245758;120916;51;136767;66;24007384615385;26;56;37;Montse Obradors;Carles Blanch;Marta Comellas;Montse Figueras;Luis Lizan;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;8470088;1.5.4;FALSE;Medicine & Public Health;Public Health;springer;springer;3;2;3;NA;1476702121;1.5;1.5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1.5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11136-016-1321-7;1465008893;1464912000;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;7;0;7;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttfff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttfff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttfff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=8470088;Quality of Life Research;Sociology, general;Public Health And Health Services;springer;springer;era

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (RevMan 5.3) of randomised controlled trials (RCT) and prospective cohort studies reporting serious infection in people taking any licensed biologic therapy for psoriasis compared with those taking placebo; non-biologic therapy; or other biologic therapies. The quality of the studies was assessed using GRADE. No significant heterogeneity was detected in data from 32 RCTs (13359 participants) and one cohort study (4993 participants). In adults, low to very low quality RCT data showed no significant difference between any biologic therapy and placebo at weeks 12-16 (overall pooled Peto odds ratio[OR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 0.36,1.41) and weeks 20-30 (OR 2.27, 95%CI 0.45,11.49). No significant differences were found in any of the other comparisons in underpowered RCT data. Prospective cohort study data of low quality suggests only adalimumab (adjusted hazard ratio 2.52, 95%CI 1.47,4.32) was associated with a significantly higher risk of serious infection compared with retinoid and/or phototherapy in adults. No association between biologic therapies and serious infections in patient with psoriasis who were eligible for RCTs was detected.

This study aimed to assess the short-term effectiveness and safety of these new agents using a network meta-analysis. Twenty seven randomized clinical trials (n=10,629) were identified by a comprehensive systematic literature review (PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015025472). Quality of evidence was assessed following Cochrane compliant rules and GRADE approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes at weeks 10-16 were compared using a random-effects network meta-analysis within a frequentist framework to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) of direct and indirect comparisons among the therapeutic options. There were 6 direct drug-to-drug comparisons in the network, with a high degree of consistency between the direct and the indirect evidence. From the available evidence, infliximab 5mg.kg-1 every eight weeks (OR: 118.89; 95%CI: 60.91-232.04) and secukinumab 300mg every four weeks (OR: 87.07;95%CI: 55.01-137.82) are shown as among the most effective short-term treatment, but are ranked as the biologic most likely to produce any adverse event (AE) or an infectious AE, respectively. Ustekinumab 90mg every twelve weeks, the third most efficacious (OR: 73.67; 95%CI: 46.97-115.56), was the only agent that did not show increased risk of adverse events when compared with placebo.

To better define the demographic, clinical features, and treatment approach of TNF-a inhibitor-induced psoriasis. Systematic review of published cases of TNF-a inhibitor-induced psoriasis. We identified 88 articles with 216 cases of new-onset TNF-a inhibitor-induced psoriasis. The mean age at psoriasis onset was 38.5 years. The most common underlying diseases were Crohn disease (40.7%) and rheumatoid arthritis (37.0%). Patients underwent TNF-a therapy for an average of 14.0 months before psoriasis onset with 69.9% of patients experiencing onset within the first year. The majority of patients received skin-directed therapy, though patients who discontinued TNF therapy had the greatest resolution of symptoms (47.7%) compared with those who switched to a different TNF agent (36.7%) or continued therapy (32.9%). Retrospective review that relies on case reports and series. While TNF-a inhibitor cessation may result in resolution of induced psoriasis, lesions may persist. Decisions regarding treatment should be weighed against the treatability of TNF-a inhibitor-induced psoriasis, the severity of the background rheumatologic or gastrointestinal disease, and possible loss of efficacy with cessation followed by retreatment. Skin-directed therapy is a reasonable initial strategy except in severe cases.;7822841;66331098478245;3044468;60;4753225;3232;75642946456205;1577;51;1649;245128;1252914666275;88418;63;155500;109;14024074074074;59;45;50;Brown, Gabrielle;Wang, Eva;Leon, Argentina;Huynh, Monica;Wehner, Mackenzie;Matro, Rebecca;Linos, Eleni;Liao, Wilson;Haemel, Anna;Gabrielle Brown;Eva Wang;Argentina Leon;Monica Huynh;Mackenzie Wehner;Rebecca Matro;12457405;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;3;4;NA;1493374566;2.75;2.75;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;2.75;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2016.08.012;1475712630;1476223841;NA;NA;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;16;0;16;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=3&types=ttttttff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=3&types=ttttttff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=3&types=ttttttff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=12457405;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Estimates for the United States and Europe suggest that psoriasis accounts for 4% of skin diseases in children. In most cases, the condition is mild and can be treated with creams. However, a small percentage of children have moderate to severe disease that requires drugs, such as ciclosporin or methotrexate, and some will require injections with newer biological agents, such as anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor) drugs. Anti-TNF drugs (among them etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) are designed to reduce inflammation in the body caused by tumour necrosis factor. Evidence for the safety and efficacy of these biological agents in paediatric psoriasis is lacking. To assess the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of paediatric psoriasis. We searched the following databases up to July 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched 13 trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and key review articles for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We handsearched conference proceedings and attempted to contact trial authors and relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's and European Medicines Agency's adverse effects databases. All relevant RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in individuals less than 18 years of age. Two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts and performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included studies. One review author entered data into Review Manager (RevMan), and a second review author checked the data. We also attempted to obtain unclear data from the trial authors where possible.Our primary outcomes were investigator-assessed number of participants achieving a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index-75 (PASI 75) compared to baseline, improvement in quality of life using an instrument such as Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), and adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants achieving PASI 50 and the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). We included one study with 211 participants (median age 13 years), in which etanercept (dosage ranged from 0.8 to 50 mg per kilogram of body weight) was compared to placebo. Follow-up was over a 48-week period.At week 12, 57% versus 11% who received etanercept or placebo, respectively, achieved the PASI 75 (risk ratio 4.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.83 to 8.65; high-quality evidence). Absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat to obtain a benefit with etanercept was 45% (95% CI 33.95 to 56.40) and 2 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.95), respectively.The percentage improvement from baseline of the CDLQI scores at week 12 was better in the etanercept group than the placebo group (52.3% versus 17.5%, respectively (P = 0.0001)). Analysis between the groups showed an effect size that was clinically important (mean difference 2.30, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.75; high-quality evidence). However, means, medians, and minimal important difference results and results of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Stein Impact on Family Scale, and Harter Self-Perception Profile for Children scores must be interpreted with caution, as they were not prespecified outcomes.Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were resolved without sequelae. Deaths or other events such as malignant tumours, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or demyelination were not reported in the included study.Also, 13% of participants in the placebo group and 53% in the etanercept group had a PGA of clear or almost clear (risk ratio 3.96, 95% CI 2.36 to 6.66; high-quality evidence) at week 12. This review found only one RCT evaluating the use of this type of biological therapy. Although the risk of publication bias was high, as we included only one industry-sponsored RCT, the risk of allocation, selection, performance, attrition, and selective reporting biases for all outcomes (except for CDLQI) was low, and no short-term serious adverse events were found.We can conclude, based on this single included study, that etanercept seems to be efficacious and safe (at least in the short term) for the treatment of paediatric psoriasis. However, as the GRADE approach refers not to individual studies but to a body of evidence, we shall wait for the results of the ongoing studies in a future update of this review. In addition, future studies should evaluate quality-of-life endpoints established a priori and standardise primary outcome measures such as PASI 75, and should include the PGA as a secondary endpoint. Also, collating and reporting adverse events uniformly is required to better evaluate safety.";7377337;64097701099652;1696289;76;5648404;8495;1626768118672;5240;37;3155;285441;88288470641815;78129;72;206125;212;24175327014218;157;25;55;Sanclemente, Gloria;Murphy, Ruth;Contreras, Javier;García, Hermenegildo;Bonfill Cosp, Xavier;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4806176;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;9;5;7;NA;1473607861;3.25;2.25;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3.25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd010017.pub2;1448466562;1448488853;healthservicesresearch;medicine;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;48;0;48;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=4&types=tttttfff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=4&types=tttttfff;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=4&types=tttttfff;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4806176;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Several systemic therapies exist for moderate to severe psoriasis, including oral fumaric acid esters (FAE). These contain dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the main active ingredient, and monoethyl fumarate. FAE are licensed for psoriasis in Germany but used off-licence in many countries. To assess the effects and safety of oral fumaric acid esters for psoriasis. We searched the following databases up to 7 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched six conference proceedings that were not already included in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FAE, including DMF monotherapy, in individuals of any age and sex with a clinical diagnosis of psoriasis. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and the proportion of participants discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects. We included 6 studies (2 full reports, 2 abstracts, 1 brief communication, and 1 letter), with a total of 544 participants. Risk of bias was unclear in several studies because of insufficient reporting. Five studies compared FAE with placebo, and one study compared FAE with methotrexate. All studies reported data at 12 to 16 weeks, and we identified no longer-term studies. When FAE were compared with placebo, we could not perform meta-analysis for the primary outcome of PASI score because the three studies that assessed this outcome reported the data differently, although all studies reported a significant reduction in PASI scores with FAE. Only 1 small study designed for psoriatic arthritis reported on the other primary outcome of participants discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects (2 of 13 participants on FAE compared with none of the 14 participants on placebo; risk ratio (RR) 5.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 102.1; 27 participants; very low-quality evidence). However, these findings are uncertain due to indirectness and a very wide confidence interval. Two studies, containing 247 participants and both only reported as abstracts, allowed meta-analysis for PASI 50, which showed superiority of FAE over placebo (RR 4.55, 95% CI 2.80 to 7.40; low-quality evidence), with a combined PASI 50 of 64% in those given FAE compared with a PASI 50 of 14% for those on placebo, representing a number needed to treat to benefit of 2. The same studies reported more participants achieving PASI 75 with FAE, but we did not pool the data because of significant heterogeneity; none of the studies measured PASI 90. One study reported significant improvement in participants' quality of life (QoL) with FAE, measured with Skindex-29. However, we could not compute the mean difference because of insufficient reporting in the abstract. More participants experienced adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal disturbance and flushing, on FAE (RR 4.72, 95% CI 2.45 to 9.08; 1 study, 99 participants; moderate-quality evidence), affecting 76% of participants given FAE and 16% of the placebo group (representing a number needed to treat to harm of 2). The other studies reported similar findings or did not report adverse effects fully.One study of 54 participants compared methotrexate (MTX) with FAE. PASI score at follow-up showed superiority of MTX (mean Difference (MD) 3.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.92; 51 participants; very low-quality evidence), but the difference was not significant after adjustment for baseline disease severity. The difference between groups for the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment due to adverse effects was uncertain because of imprecision (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.53; 1 study, 51 participants; very low-quality evidence). Overall, the number of participants experiencing common nuisance adverse effects was not significantly different between the 2 groups, with 89% of the FAE group affected compared with 100% of the MTX group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03; 54 participants; very low-quality evidence). Flushing was more frequent in those on FAE, with 13 out of 27 participants affected compared with 2 out of 27 given MTX. There was no significant difference in the number of participants who attained PASI 50, 75, and 90 in the 2 groups (very low-quality evidence) whereas this study did not measure the effect of treatments on QoL. The included studies reported no serious adverse effects of FAE and were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects. Evidence suggests that FAE are superior to placebo and possibly similar in efficacy to MTX for psoriasis; however, the evidence provided in this review was limited, and it must be noted that four out of six included studies were abstracts or brief reports, restricting study reporting. FAE are associated with nuisance adverse effects, including flushing and gastrointestinal disturbance, but short-term studies reported no serious adverse effects.";7693476;66032853252866;1682550;77;5997358;8647;16779507055286;5101;40;3505;226816;85214651059234;59052;73;167133;269;25268410447761;187;30;81;Atwan, Ausama;Ingram, John R;Abbott, Rachel;Kelson, Mark J;Pickles, Timothy;Bauer, Andrea;Piguet, Vincent;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4384055;1.5.4;FALSE;NA;NA;NA;NA;8;6;6;NA;1463131877;3.75;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3.75;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd010497.pub2;1439290652;1439330417;healthservicesresearch;medicine;Medicine;Health Sciences;NA;NA;0;34;0;34;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=4&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=4&types=tttttttt;https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=4&types=tttttttt;http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4384055;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We also searched 100 unselected RCTs of psoriasis therapy and all 112 RCTs of phototherapy for psoriasis in the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials for separate stratification for guttate psoriasis. Randomised trials in which patients with acute guttate psoriasis were randomised to different treatments, except those trials examining antistreptococcal interventions which are addressed in a separate Cochrane review. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. No published report could be found to support or to challenge current commonly used methods of management. Only one trial which met the selection criteria was identified. In this small study of 21 hospitalised patients with guttate psoriasis, intravenous infusion of an n-3 fatty acid rich lipid emulsion was compared with placebo emulsion containing n-6 fatty acids. The n-3 preparation appeared to be of some benefit for patients with guttate psoriasis. There is currently no firm evidence on which to base treatment of acute guttate psoriasis.
